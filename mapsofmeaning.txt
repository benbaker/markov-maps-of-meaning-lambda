I should tell you first
about the genesis of this
theory I suppose is the right way of putting it
when I was about your age
that was back in the
early 80’s
or thereabouts
and this was particularly true around 1984 but it was true before that too
every generation has its worries
real or imagined
the primary worry
for people of my generation was nuclear war
and you know it was a genuine worry
at one point many years later
I went down to Arizona
to visit an ICBM a decommissioned ICBM
nuclear missile silo
and ICBM intercontinental ballistic missile were very large rockets
right they
flew at they could fly half way around the world
it was deep underground and behind very thick
steel doors it was light green you know that pastel green
that everyone seemed to like in the 1950’s
it was like pastel green Star Trek console
that’s what it looked like
and ah
so we went down
out in the yard it was in the desert  out in the yard there was a very
I would say
magical object
for lack of a better word
and that was the nose cone
for the ICBM
and it was quite big
about that big about that high pointed like the point of a bullet
about ¾’s of an inch thick plastic
you know kind of a resin
and it was designed to melt on re-entry
so that was just sitting there
so that was fairly
thought provoking let’s put it that way
and then we went into
the missile silo
interestingly enough
appended to the front of it it had been decommissioned under Regan by the way
in the front of it there was a museum
with
artifacts from the 1980’s featuring Reagan
and Gorbachev meeting multiple times
and it was staffed by these
Southern
these Americans from the South who were grandparent age and they were
and they were just super friendly
and you know  they were happy to be in the museum and it was like going to visit
your grandma’s nuclear missile silo
and so it was jarring you know because it was obviously a portentous
place and yet it was conjoined with hospitality and welcoming
it was surreal in that manner
anyways we went into the
into the silo
and they ran us through a
simulated launch so imagine
a panel like this made out of metal except twice as long with another one of these things at the other end 16 feet across or so
basically 1950’s technology
but updated and then imagine what you had to do to launch it
was that there was a guy with a key and there was  another guy with a key and if I remember correctly the keys were around their necks
although I don’t think that they were stored around their necks permanently but
and so to launch the missile you had to put the key in the lock
both of you that was the safety
precaution had to be two of you
put the key in the lock and hold it for 10 seconds and then
away the missile goes and it wasn’t as big the missile wasn’t as big as the rockets that went to the moon
but
but it was plenty big you know the silo itself would have easily been
as wide as this room is
and perhaps larger and many many story’s tall you know because it was nested underground
so they ran us through a simulated launch which was
surreal I would say and then they told us that
someone asked that the keys were in once
now they wouldn’t tell us when but
you know that would have been during the Cuban missile crisis
because we were that close
and we were close again at other times although perhaps not that close
and there seemed to be another peak of
conflict in 1984
when there was a movie showed at that time called
“The Day After”
which at that time
garnered more views than any movie ever had on TV and it was
a story about
the aftermath of a nuclear war and the people that were left and it was
pretty realistic and
and pretty frightening  it it turned out
as I found out later that
that movie was one of things that influenced Ronald Reagan to
put pressure on or negotiate with the Soviets depending on how
you look at it
and so
well then you know 5 years later
the Soviet union collapsed no one saw that coming
and it really didn’t collapse in 1989 in some sense you know like
a huge machine like that
doesn’t fall apart all at once it falls apart over time and then at some point it just
becomes unsustainable and topples
and  you know it’s like they lost faith in their doctrine
and for good reason
you know that
the system in Russia
the Soviet Union which was a collection of states
an empire
and the system that Mao establish in China and
the system that still exists in Korea
as a remnant of the cold war
and systems in South East Asia and in Africa
were all predicated on
Marxist presuppositions
presuppositions that were Utopian in nature
and that
and that posited a Utopian future where
property was held in common and everyone had
enough
and everyone was called upon to do what they could
ight from each according
to his ability to each according to his need
which is a lovely sentiment and you can imagine
how it would be attractive
even intellectually because of course
other systems all other systems
produce vast disparities in income
it’s like a natural law that’s actually
governed by you can model it
with a distribution called the Pareto distribution and the Pareto distribution looks like this
it doesn’t look like a normal distribution a lot of you guys have been told about not  normal distributions and how
many things
many things follow on normal distribution most things but that’s really
a limited case
you can understand a Pareto distribution if you
you’ve all played Monopoly I presume
at the beginning
everyone has the same amount of money
we will include property the same amount of wealth
and then what happens as the game progresses and really as a function of chance
I mean I know that you have to use a head a little bit in Monopoly but
the basic rule is just buy everything you can get your hands on
and then trade meanly something like that
so at the beginning everybody has the same amount
and then as you begin to play
if you had enough players you would develop a normal distribution
because some people would win
relatively consistently and some players lose relatively consistently
and so the money starts to be distributed
in a normal distribution but
the thing about money and the thing about lots of things
is that zero is involved
and zero is a weird place
because if you are playing a trading game and you hit zero
then you’re done
and so and it is very hard to recover from zero and you know
it’s really hard to recover you know when you are doomed in Monopoly
you know you you can tell you’ve got some resources but
there is going to be some crisis when you land on some hotel
and you are going to get wiped out you know it so
there is a point at which you’re headed for zero even if you have
something
you know and you might be rescued by
luck
but you know when you are doomed
So what happens as you continue to play Monopoly
more and more people stack up at zero
and fewer and fewer people
have more and more money
and when the game is over
every person has no money and one person has all of it
now the funny thing about that is
in some sense that is how trading games work
you know you got you might wonder why there is inequality in a society
and it is easy to consider that it’s because the society is corrupt
and perhaps
you know society is somewhat or horribly corrupt
that is the variation there is no
society that is not without its criminal
element its fixed element
anyways
trading games tend to produce a Pareto distribution so that very many have very little
and a tiny minority have a tremendous amount
that’s the 1% that you hear about right
and the thing about the 1% is that
it has happened in every society that has ever been studied
it doesn’t really matter what the governmental system is it certainly
happened under the Soviets that’s for sure
and there was enough people that had enough zero that they just died
so
you know the
the Utopian dream
was completely un-implementable
for a variety of very complex reasons one
is that it is very hard to fight against that distribution pattern
when people are trading because
mere statistics will do that and then there are other things and
I should tell you as well that the Pareto distribution governs a lot of things so
if you look at books if I remember properly
last year there was something like a million English language books published
and I think that 500 of them sold more than 100000 copies
which is none right that is none and of that 500 you can be sure
that one of them was by Stephen King
and he took half the money
because like there is 5 authors in the English language who are
on every airport
paperback stand occupying the top
rung and that’s massive real estate right because it is replicated everywhere
and because they are so
prominent and because they are no names
when people are in a hurry and want something to read
they just grab that and more money goes to those people so you know
success breeds success
and failure breeds failure and it not necessarily linear
and that is a really difficult thing to deal with
and it is hard on societies because
one of the things we do know is that
you know as you stretch out the inequality
you make men particularly on the lower end of the distribution
more and more likely to be aggressive
it’s sort of like you imagine every man has a threshold for violence
um and status is important to men
not that it isn’t important to women but
it’s different
it’s a different kind of status it’s status that is important to
men because  it’s one of the things that makes them
marketable as partners to women so it actually turns out to be quite important to men
men tend to compete
with one another for status hierarchy position and
in a really unequal society
if you are like a low
rung guy
then and you don’t have any opportunity to rise because
the society isn’t structured
so that there’s mobility then
the more aggressive guys
tend to turn to criminality and you know and so you could say
there is a threshold for
criminality
and the more inequality pressure you put on
a particular area geographic or political area
the more inequality pressure you put on it
the more men slip past that threshold and
into criminality and you know there have been some pretty good studies done of
drug gangs
in Chicago that was the best one a sociologist actually went out and hung out with a drug gang
he got into it I guess the drug gang leader was
you know
I wouldn’t say necessarily narcissistic that might be a reasonable
way of thinking about it
and he was kind of
happy with the idea of maybe being the subject of a book
and so this guy was able
to associate with them got to know them quite well
and then the housing project in which the
gang was housed
was slated for demolition and the gang broke up
and he got the books
because they kept books
and what he found was the average street drug dealer first of all was employed
in another job as well
and was making far less than minimum wage
now but guys further up the chain of course
followed the Pareto distribution so there was a tiny minority of them that were raking in a tremendous amount of loot
and the guys at the bottom
were just waiting around for the possibility that they could rise
up the hierarchy and you know it’s a pretty violent game so
the chances that someone’s going to be
taken out
it pretty high and so then a slot opens up for some opportunistic
second rater and perhaps he can move up the hierarchy.
So the Pareto distribution governs all sorts of other things too I mentioned
it governs the popularity of books
the sales of books
but it also it also
characterizes the distribution of everything that people produce
so if you think of creative production of any sort artistic production industrial production
it doesn’t matter
almost everything fails
and a few things succeed
beyond anyone’s wildest imagination
Apples’ a good example of that you know I mean the iPhone
they have their competitors but
it is an extraordinarily dominant product and they rake in billions of dollars
don’t know if Apple is valued at a trillion dollars but
it’s close to that
and that is a lot of money and I think if I remember correctly
it something like this I probably have the figures wrong but the top 40 people
the richest 40 people in the world have as much money as the bottom 2 billion
right now you know it not like they are stuffing their mattresses with that money
or they have a skyscraper full of cash that money  is out in the
economy doing whatever money does so
you can’t spend 28 billion dollars
so and sometimes you can even do some good with it you know Bill Gates seems to be
doing something reasonable with his money
but the reason I am telling you this is because one of the things you should know
is that
this proclivity for inequality
is pervasive among the products of human beings
it is the case with
the goals scored in hockey my son told me
and he is a reliable source on hockey statistics that
if Wayne Gretzky if you don’t count any of the points that Wayne Gretzky managed with scoring
he still had enough points just with assists to have more points than any hockey player that ever played
so
you know even at the upper end
of the distribution
there is some person whose aahh that is so good at what they do
and then there is another person that is so much better than them that it is not even comparable
and so
and the benefits flow to people who are in that position and you can understand why I would say because
you know say you start writing and you get a book
and
rare things very rare things to have happen and some people read it and they like it and then of course
it is much more likely that you’ll get a next book
and if people like that then it is even more likely that you will get a third book and then people start to know who you are
and then because they know who you are they phone you up and offer you opportunities and your network grows
it’s like this exponential
increase in your reach and your capacity for production and
more and more flows to you and
then on the other hand
if you start to fail and you know why would someone fail well God
one idea that is very common in our culture is that poverty is caused by lack of money and that’s a very stupid idea
because money is very difficult to handle I had clients who were drug addicts
and the worst possible thing that could happen to them is that they got some money
they’re just done first of all they were hanging around with people who were
a little on the sociopathic side and so
especially if they weren’t that bright and couldn’t defend themselves very well
as soon as they got money well it was off to the bar with all the friends and you know
one guy I remember in particular you know every time he got his
his disability cheque
he was gone for 5 days you would find him in a ditch you know because he would go to the bar
spend every cent he had on alcohol and cocaine and
wake up in a ditch ¾’s dead
well eventually completely dead and
you know then he was ashamed and horrified and repentant and
he would straighten himself out again and then that was all well and good until as long he was broke
until the next cheque showed up and then bang the same thing so you know
it’s not like money is necessarily a good for everyone
it’s hard to manage money it’s really easy for it to disappear I mean elderly people have a hell of a time now because
you know crooks are contacting them on the Internet non-stop and so
just giving people money
money it’s like it’s like pouring water in their hands
it’s not that helpful not necessarily that helpful and then of course
contributors to poverty are  well it’s not that helpful to have a low IQ
you know people don’t like the idea of IQ
because it seems so arbitrary you know have a high IQ
well it’s not like you deserve it exactly
you are set up that way pretty much right from the beginning it’s a very very very very stable.
You can make a high IQ person stupider
by not educating them up to the level of their possibility but
taking someone who has a low IQ trying to raise that it’s like if you can figure out how to do that
well you know it’s Nobel Prize time for you because people have tried that a lot
and most recently with those you know Luminosity Lumosity games and that sort of thing the evidence that those produce
anything other than brilliant performances on the Lumosity game itself
is basically zero.  We haven’t been able to figure out how to
see ‘cause intelligence is a cross domain phenomena
and you can get really good in a single domain by practising like mad
and what you want is to practise like mad in a single domain and hope that it generalizes to other domains
that’s the holy grail of intelligence increase no
no one has done it people claim it but the claims never hold up and people have been trying for a long time
to do it and then haven’t been able to do it and
difference in IQ really make a difference you know I mean
you guys average IQ’s is probably 125 130
at 115 you are at the 85th percentile
and 115 would barely get you going for a hard university
130 you are probably graduate school material you know 145
you are up there
at the range probably where you can pretty much do whatever you want
but as you get smarter the scatter between your abilities increases
so you might have a very high verbal IQ but not be so good at mathematics or the other way around
but it’s a massive contributor to lifetime success
and I don’t know what to do about that.
Why do smart people make more money?
Well they get to where the edge of production is faster
so if you have a 1000 people and you rank order them by IQ the smart people are going to come up with the new ideas first
and they are going to have more ideas and they are going to strategize better and
you know with an IQ of 90 which is
15% of the population think about that 15% of the population
that is pretty much the threshold for reading instructions and being able to follow them
so you know and our society is increasing sophisticated  so
it is by no means obvious
you know the liberals think well
that society is unfair because there is unemployment and conservatives think
that well there is a job for everyone
but none of them think well there are massive massive massive differences in people’s ability
far greater than anyone realizes
and that poses a structural problem.
I had a client
and I got him a volunteer job which is way harder than you think
you need a police check for example
Like it's harder to get a volunteer job than a real job
But I We got him in a volunteer job and
he had to fold
pieces of paper letters it was he worked at a charity
he had to fold pieces of paper in three so that he could put them inside envelopes
and
and the the letters which were in a pile had to matched with the proper envelopes
which were also in a pile some of them were French and some of them were English
so the French ones had to be carefully matched to the French
envelopes and and then if you know if there was one envelope out of
order well then he had to figure out whether it was the papers
that were out of order or the letters that were out of order
and then
Some of the letters had photographs attached to them
and you weren't supposed to bend the photographs but
they weren't all in the same place so that meant you had to figure out how to fold
the paper in three a bunch of different ways without creasing the photograph
and then the other thing is
and I never realized how difficult it is to put a piece of paper in an envelope
until I watched someone that couldn't do it
and he probably had an IQ of about 80
you know if you met him on the street you wouldn't think anything different of him
he was a normal looking guy
had some other problems
I trained to fold those damn papers for like 30 hours
and he got reasonably good at it but
you know if you are good at it
and you probably all are
you fold it and the edges line up exactly
like really exactly the tolerance is probably  1/2 a millimeter or something like that
and then you do the second fold
and the tolerance is the same
but let's imagine the first fold that you
you are out by an 1/8th of an inch and the second fold you are out by an 1/8th of an inch
so it's a little crooked and that means in total you are out by a 1/4 of an inch
then it won't fit in the damn envelope
so then you kind of crumple the envelope when you put it there and then it gets stuck in the sorting machine
and so
he sweated blood trying to do that job and eventually they
eventually planned to fire him
so imagine what that's  like eh you know
you can't get a job
and then so you get a job at a charity as a volunteer
and a charity decides to fire you
you know I mean really
that's just so I talked to the women who was running it and
suggested that
that might be a little on the devastating side I mean she had her reasaons
you know
he he. he was always asking people questions about how to do his job
and you know so that meant he was interfering with the productivity of other people
and it was genuine interference I mean she wasn't being mean
and it was her job to make sure that the place did what it was supposed to so
and you know she was between a rock and a hard place
he eventually decided that the job wasn't for him
relatively soon after that I think it was too stressful
and uh
he quit so that solved that problem except then  he didn't have a job
which of course is a problem
it has a happy ending this story as  far as I know
um he
he got a dog because he was very lonesome and that dog man
having that guy train that dog that was something else that dog just
I think he lost thirty pounds while he was training that dog
because dogs you know they are dominant
he had to have a tussle with the dog to figure out who was in charge and it's a lot of responsibility to have a dog
but he was pretty damn committed to that dog
and he managed it the things he went through
to keep that dog you cannot possibly imagine it's like a like a
it was surreal just like the nuclear missile silo I mean he had people following him around informing
on him because they thought he was abusing the dog
when in fact because I watched the dog was clearly abusing him
so
he got a job helping a women who trained dogs
and then he had a job
so hurray you know but
it was like a miracle fundamentally so
Anyways the reason I am telling you all this is because
there was a reason for the Cold War
and the reason was that
there is inequality
and there are different theories how to address that
inequality and different theories as to why it exists
and there was a Marxist theory
about why it exists which was roughly something  like property equal theft
and those who have more have taken it from those who have less
which
seems to me to eliminate any conceptualization that there isn't a fixed pot of money
you know money expands actually  as we become more technologically proficient
and
lots of people who have money have it because generated a lot of wealth
Bill Gates is a great example of that right he popularized computing he made it possible for everybody to
to have access to computing it's like it seems like a good good for him you know
and you could say the same thing about Steve Jobs
and maybe you will be able to say the same thing about Elon Musk and
you know these guys have tremendous resources at their diposal
but
you know they're not like
bathing in bank notes you know they're
trying to continue to do things they use their money to do things
anyways
The Russians set themselves up under Marxist presuppositions
and tried to
equalize the distribution of property
and
to call that catastrophic barely scratches the surface I know that
you guys probably don't learn much about this because for some reason
people aren't taught about it but
good estimates are that the Russians killed about 30 million of their own people between 1919 and 1959
you know and it's
brutal
brutal a lot of that was through starvation
you know I saw a photograph the other day which I tweeted
which is the worst photograph I have ever seen in my life and that is actually saying a lot because
I have seen a lot of really terrible photographs because I've
done so much investigation into totalitarianism
this was a photograph taken during one of the early
starvation  periods in the Soviet Union where about three million peasants died
was a picture of a peasant couple
standing behind a table at a market selling human body parts for food
and you know I have this weird quirk
which I don't think does me much good but
maybe
helps me understand things better
when I see that someone has dome something
extreme
I learned to this a long time ago when I worked briefly in a maximum security prison
I try to imagine what I would have to like
what kind of situation  what sort of situation would I have to find myself in
to do that
and believe me man
that's a horrifying enterprise because
it is actually possible
no matter what you read about someone doing
and no matter how unlikely you think that you would do that
It's possible
to imagine yourself in that situation and that
well that's enlightening that's what I would say that's enlightening
you know because one of the things about enlightenment
is that
you get enlightened by doing
things that necessary that you really really really do not want to know
don't want to do
and imagine imagining yourself as a perpetrator of that sort
is
that tells you something about the world and it tells you something about human beings but
it's a hell of thing to swallow you know in a very
well structured society such as ours
where we are so peaceful
well because we have the heat
and it always works and we have electricity and it always works
and we have plumbing which a  bloody miracle and it always works
you know it's just
One of the things that this imagination process has done for me is keep me alert
to the absolute miracle that my life is everyday
It's horrbly cold out there
You can't grow any food
You'd die if you were out there for 24 hours
If any of the infrastructure was unreliable for any length of time we would be in serious trouble
and it's never unreliable
It's so unlikely
and so we are with all this reliable infrastructure
and because of that we don't have to compete with each other much
You don't compete for food
You don't compete for shelter or some people do but not many
So it really easy to think of yourself as good because
You're not doing anything nasty to anyone
but you know  a cynic might say well that that's just because you don't have any reason to
but those reasons have arisen many times in the past and
in fact they're the norm not the exception  we're the exception this insanely functional society that
we have somehow managed to generate is
it is incomprehensible to me that it exists
so Anyways
back in the industrial the end of the industrial revolution
The conditions of the worker were pretty brutal
I mean George Orwell wrote a book called Road to Wigan Pier which I highly recommend it's a great book
and he went up in the 30's
I think it was the 30's
To work to live with the coal miners up in Northern U.K.
and those poor guys
your know they had to crawl to work for two miles down a tunnel that they couldn't stand up in
just to start their shift
and after their 8 hours of hacking away at the coal walls
which is rather difficult dirty and dangerous
and of course you get black lung from it fatal and of course they didn't get paid very much
so after doing that for 8 hours
then you  crawled back your 2 miles
and you didn't get paid for that that was just the commute
and the housing for those people
was not good the food wasn''t good most of them had not teeth by the time they were 30
you know I mean
being poor was no joke even in a place like the U.K. which was relatively well off
and so there was every reason to be
concerned between the disparity between rich andpoor
and poor is the natural state you know
In the Western world in 1895 the typical person lived on a dollar a day in today's dollars
and you know that's not
uncommon in many places in the world now
so there are reasons to be concerned with inequality
and you know  the Russians took one pathway inspired by Marx and we took another pathway
inspired by John Stuart Mill and John Locke
the English tradition I would so democracy
and competed for 70 years
and things seem to have worked out better here
but with a hell of a competition
and there were real differences of opinion at the bottom of it
and those two systems turned into armed camps and that's not over exactly you know I mean
there are Chinese although  they're a hybrid now between Communism and capitalism
and hopefully they are more interested in getting rich  than they are in you know
having a war
greed is a good motivator
surprisingly enough it is kind of reliable
but anyways by 1989 the jig was up
it was obvious that the Soviet system was not functional 
there was no consumer goods that's for sure even in the main department stores in Moscow
people just kind of lost faith in the whole project
for a while I don't know if you know about the show Dallas
Dallas was a soap opera that ran at night
a serial and uh it was about these rich
Texans who lived you know a 1% lifestyle
and it was the most popular show in East Germany
the streets would empty so people could watch Dallas
well when you are sitting in you horrible Soviet architecture flat
that you know you had to struggle to get with your  informing
relatives because 1 out of 3 people in East Germany was an informer a government informer
and you watch Dallas you know there is a little cognitive dissonance occurring
and so it fell apart
quite peacefully actually you know there was a war in
there was a bit of a war in Eastern Europe
but it fell apart remarkably peacefully and so here we are
and we don't know what do with the pesky Russians but
at least there is no evidence that they are our mortal enemies for fundamental reasons of axiomatic presupposition
and things are a lot better in the world
despite what everyone tells you
than they were 40 years ago and they are so much better than they
were 50 years ago that is absolutely staggering
We have lifted more people out of poverty in the last 15 years
that have been lifted out of poverty in the entire history of the world before then
people are gathering economic resources
at a rate that even the wildest optimist really couldn't dream of speeding up
so It's not like we are not without our problems but
So during that period of time
I was obsessed would be a good word
with a question and the question was
Why would human beings produce two camps and then produce a massive arsenal of hydrogen bombs
and I don't know what you know about hydrogen bombs but they have atom bombs for triggers
and you know that's worth thing because an atom bomb you know hey that's
that's something but a hydrogen bomb
that's the sun that's really something
so and you know at the peak of the cold war and this is still true to some degree
there were literally tens of thousands of these weapons aimed
at the Soviet Union and at the West and
that was enough
pretty much put and end to everything
and that's a dangerous game man you know and
not only because of intent but also because of the possibility of accidental
just an accident you know
just a mistake or just someone whose a little crazier than you might want them to be
you know and you might think well no one would want to bring about the destruction of the world  but
that just means you don't know very much about Stalin
because of all the people who lived in the 20th century who had power
Stalin was the most motivated to bring everything to an end
There is some evidence that he was murdered by
Khrushchev and his crew and Khrushchev was the next leader
and if he was not murdered he was at least not provided with medical attention when he was dying
and uh there is reasonable evidence that he was gearing to invade Western Europe
and he really didn't care how much destruction would go along with that
I mean he had already killed tens of millions of people
he had a lot of practice he was good at it it didn't really bother him maybe even enjoyed it
so what the hell that's what I thought how can it be that you are doing this it's so insane
so then I started to think about belief systems you know
because you could say that each camp had it's own belief system the one in the West was derived
and had a very lengthy history
derived from the Greeks and the Romans and the Jews and the Christians
and from various schools of philosophy and from the Enlightenment and all that and then
the Soviet Union was basically predicated on a rational philosophy
that that opposed the axioms that the West had evolved
and each group organized their societies around that and
Now I took political science for quite a long time
and the political scientists and the economists
they basically thought that people competed over resources
but that wasn't a very good answer as far as I was concerned because it wasn't obvious to me why people valued the resources they valued
The economists just assumed that there are resources that you valued but
but you know people can value a lot of different things it's
it's not exactly fixed I mean you tend to value food very highly if you are hungry obviously but
but there are lots of thing that we value and that we want that
seem somewhat arbitrary somewhat like a decision
so I got more interested in why people valued things and what it meant to value something
and then what it meant to believe something
and then how it could be that someone could believe something so deeply
that they would risk their own death to
protect it or at least risk the death of other people
and maybe on a massive scale like man people are committeda  to their system
now you know a system of belief is not just a system of belief that's one of the things I came to understand is that it's not
appropriate to make this too psychological
people defend their belief systems but that's not exactly right you know
we have a shared belief system
well it's sufficiently shared so that here we are
we don't know each other we are a bunch of primates
we are in this room and it's peaceful and no one's scared
and that's pretty amazing and that means we are all acting out our roles
so we acting out our roles and we have an expectation with regard to those roles
and those two things match
and that's the important thing and we will talk about that a lot
it isn't the belief system or the integrity of the belief system even
it's the match between the belief system and the actions of the other people within the belief system
what you want to maintain is that match
you want to act out your beliefs
in the world and you want what you want to happen
that's a good thing you get what you want and you validate your belief system 
great perfect security
but a lot of that is we are interacting even right now
there is a whole set of expectations that are governing what we are doing  like you don't want me to take your
little tablet there and smash it that would be
shocking right you wouldn't know what the hell to do
right you would be somewhere different it I did that
and you wouldn't know where you were
and that is another thing to know because
that is a fundamental difference there is a fundamental difference
between knowing where you are
and not knowing where you are
I think that it's in some sense the fundamental difference you can think about it as the distinction between
explored and unexplored territory but you have to
I don't know if you have taken a cat to a new house cats hate that
and because in their old house and maybe in their old neighborhood they've slunk around
you know at the edges checking everything out
they start out afraid
they check everything out they know where to hide they now what's safe
and they know that because they go somewehere
and nothing happens so then they assume that it is safe
and they slowly build up a neighborhood that they are comfortable with
My dad used to take the dog for a walk and the cat got lonesome and it started to follow him and
First of all it would go along the buildings the houses on their route
hiding really from predators and
after a while it got kind off comfortable with that then it follow right behind the dog
but it had a border and if
my dad took the dog over one street to many for the cat
the cat would just sit on the corner and
you know cry like a cat cries it was like
that's it for me man I am not going any further out into the unknown
and so
the distinction between the territory that you have mastered
and the territory that you haven't mastered is a fundamental distinction
it is the distinction between home and the strange land
and the thing about familiar territory for people is that most of the familiar territory that we inhabit
is other people
because we are so social you can't really think
it's a weird way of thinking about territory it's not exactly geographical objective territory it's
territory with a dominance hierarchy in it
and the dominance hierarchy has a predictable structure
and you know where you fit in it most of the time
and so when you act out in that territory surrounded by your people
then often you get what you want and you are so thrilled about that because
you just don't want someone acting erratically around you like and you know that so you walk down Bloor
and there are people there that really should be institutionalized but
we de-institutionalized them all so that they could be free and free to be you know
suffering and malfunctioning and out on the street that's what the freedom ended up being
but you know you'll walk by someone like that whose
muttering away to the voices in his head and you know maybe
striking out against what ever it is that's plaguing him and
you'll make eye contact
you might even go across the street you are certainly give him a wide berth you are going to keep a distance between him and you
and you are going to hope that you don't attract his attention
because he's not in the dominance hierarchy
and you don't know what the hell he might do
and that's unexplored territory too
and that's another way of thinking about it
We inhabit time and space not just space and not just time we inhabit time and space
and out territories are spatio-temporal we are here - now
and this is safe now
and it's safe partly because of the physical structure and it's working
but it's also because none of you are manifesting peculiar behaviour
but if you started to manifest peculiar behaviour
if you stood up and started muttering or yelling
or maybe attacking someone next to you
all the rest of you freeze first because all of a sudden this would be unexplored territory
the match between what you want which is a peaceful lecture that you hope has some content
the match between what you want and what is happening has vanished
and so then you're not you don't know where you are
and so what do you do when you don't know where you are
what do you do when you don't know what to do
well if you are a computer then you just crash
but you know what good is that to you you are just going to die that isn't helpful
you freeze first and then you maybe cautiously attend or maybe you don't maybe you just keep you're damn eyes averted
and you sit there and you hope that no one notices you
that's a prey response right that's like a rabbit frozen when it thinks a fox is looking at it
and we were prey animals for a long time
there was a cat
that they recently discovered 
a prehistoric cat that had this bottom single tooth
and they found out that a human skull fit right inside it's mouth and so it could grab you here and pierce the back of your skull with it's
single tooth and that is what it was evolved for so you know
It's under such conditions we evolved and we are predators obviously
but we are tasty predators and so other things were perfectly happy to eat us
and so where you are don't know what to do you act like a prey animal
and that is probably what you should do because maybe if you keep your head down
and shut the hell up
there won't be any attention attracted to you
and maybe you will get through it
you might decide unlikely to intervene
and take the guy down
but you would be the exception rather than the norm and it's unsurprising
OK so What is came to understand is that belief systems regulated emotions
but not exactly psychologically like it isn't exactly
it isn't exactly and this is sort of like the terror management theories it's not exactly like you have a theory
in your head and because the theory explains the world and because the theory explains the world
the theory is what is making you secure
it's kind of like that it's like you have a theory in you head
and the theory makes you feel secure because it explains the world
but the reason it explains the world is because other people have the theory in their head
and when you both act out the theory
you both get what you want and it's the coming together of the theory
and the outcome that makes you
it's life
not only does it stop you from being anxious and often make you happy because you get what you want but
it's not just psychological you know the fact that we do this that we cooperate
within our societies we match our belief systems and then act them out
that's the predicate a productive society
so it's actually it isn't that just that it saves you from death anxiety like the terror management
theorists have it it saves you from death
and that's good I mean being protected from death anxiety yay well good
that's great too man but actually not dying that sort of the fundamental thing that you are after
and so people have reason to defend their territory
if you think of territory that way if you think about it as a domain where the fundamental presuppositions
of each citizen are matched by the behavior of their co-citizens
They have every reason to defend that
and if it falls apart it can have mortally
serious consequences it's chaos you know that chaos just doesn't destabilize everybody psychologically
it destabilizes everything it can destabilize the currency
it can destabilize the industrial economy the lights can go off it's like
it's not good
so no wonder people protect it
so then I started thinking about what a belief system was
and I realized that a belief system was actually a set of moral guidelines
and moral guidelines are guidelines about how you should behave
also how you should perceive
and the reason that a moral guideline
is necessary for you to perceive is that
you can't look at anything without a hierarchy of value
right think about it how may things in this room could you look at
there is an innumerable in this room to look at
there are just all  the squares the little tiny squares in this fabric
you could look at those things for until the end of time one at a time but you don't do that
in fact if I took most of you out of this room
there is a very low probability that you would be able to tell me what color the walls were or
even if those things were on the walls
and the reason for that  is that who cares
as long as the walls don't move
color is irrelavant and there is no reason for you to remember it
it has no emotional significance it has no value and so what you do instead is
well this is what you're doing so why are you here
I don't mean in the broad metaphysical sense I mean specifically why are you here right now
and I would say that you are students obviously
and you are trying to get a degree and
you know you believe that will have some functional utility
maybe you will be a little wiser and a little more literate
and be able to think a little better and be able to write a little better and so you will actually be more functional in the world
that would be good
you know and maybe you are interested but anyways it's
You're in this particular lecture so that you can take this particular class
so that you can get a particular kind of degree
so that you can launch your life and then in your life you are probably going to meet someone that you
have a long term relationship with and you are going to have children and you are going to partake in the society and
that's why you are here all of those reasons simultaneously is why you are here
and so then
that helps you decide what to look at
and so what you look at is
at the moment or listen to is me because in principle
I am the gateway to that set of accomplishments at this moment
and so you focus on me and that's because you value that
and so what that means is that you can't even look at the world without a value structure
you know it's chaos if everything is equally unimportant or if everything is equally important
it's chaos so a value system structures
the very way that you perceive the world and I don't mean that metaphysically
there is plenty of experiments that have demonstrated that
like the invisible gorilla experiment how many of you know about the invisible gorilla experiment.  How many don't?
Well Roughly speaking what happens is that there are two teams
a white team dressed in white and a team dressed in black
and there is a video of them and the black team is passing a basketball ball back and forth
and the white team passing basketball back and forth
and you are supposed to count the times the basketball gets passed back and forth
there is only one basketball and so you know you're diligent for whatever reason
you do what the experimenter asks you
and you count the basketball tosses and you think
well that's not so hard it's like 16
so you tell them 16 and they say
Did you see the gorilla?
and half of you say what are you talking about
and the experimenter says let's watch again but this time don't count
Well sure enough like 30 seconds into the video
and you know the players fill the video screen it's not like they are 300 yards in the distance you know like little ants playing basketball they're right
filling the screen you can see their faces
Sure enough
minute into the video this guy in a gorilla suit and he is not little and neither is the gorilla suit and he comes out
bangs his chest right in the middle of the screen for five seconds and then disappears
and half more than half actually of people don't see that and it is even worse Dan Simon did another experiment where
you are at a counter you know at a store  and there is a clerk there
you are talking to the clerk and the clerk goes down
hypothetically to get something and then a different clerk pops up
and you think Hey! I would notice that!
but you don't
and you can even vary the clerk quite a bit
and
people don't notice
So
We focus on very particular things and the reason we don't notice is because it doesn't actually matter
in terms of the ongoing
our ongoing action at that point
the clerk is interchangeable
as long as the entity there acts like a clerk
that's sufficient
So
belief systems structure your perceptions value systems we are going to call them value systems
they structure you perceptions
and they also guide you actions because
you act in accordance with your values
conscious or unconscious you have values that you don't know about because you don't know yourself very well
You can tell that that you have values that you don't know very well because
sometimes you get attracted to people that you know perfectly well that's a mistake
or you are trying to tell yourself to study and you don't and you know so there's
You are not in control of yourself to any great degree
some and the more integrated you are the more control you have but you are kind of a loose collection
arguing sub-personalities and they are more or less directed towards a single goal
but it depends on how committed you are to that goal how much you have thought it through much you buy into it
how many of the contradictions in your world representation you have managed to iron out and all of that
in any case it's value systems that
govern action and perception and so we are going to take an existential
perspective a phenomenological and an existential perspective in this course and
phenomenological means that we are going to
we are going to base our presuppositions on
the idea that what you experience is real all of it
we are not really dividing the world into object and subject that isn't how this particular approach works it's more like
you have a field of experience it includes things like pain
which is not really something objective I mean
but it's real I mean one of the things I've come to understand isdon't.
You are not required to believe what I am telling you by the way
If you have an argument
about why some of this doesn't make sense
then you know follow that sucker because I am trying to tell you what I have reached with regards to bedrock presuppositions and I haven't been able to
put prybars underneath them but that doesn't mean you won't
and you know you should try anyways
Moral system
tells you how to act  what to see
and a shared moral system keeps your emotions under control and fulfills your motivational needs
Now there is this old idea
of David Hume's
and David Hume famously posited that you cannot derive and ought from and is
and what he meant by that was that merely knowing the objective facts about something
does not tell you how to implement those facts in your life
and that's actually a gap now you could say and I think that this is the case
that is a necessary consequence of the scientific endeavour because
one of the things you are trying to do as a scientist is to strip away the value of the object right because
I don't care what your idiosyncratic notion of the object is
I want to know how you perceive the object
such that everyone else will perceive it at least that way
and so that takes the subjectivity completely out of it and so it might just be a
necessary consequence of the scientific method
that it doesn't have a morality implicit in it
people argue about that Sam Harris for example argues he believes that we can come up with a scientific morality
I don't believe that because I don't think that you can make rational judgments about value it's too complicated
it's far to complicated it's something that has to emerge it can't be
I mean Marxism was supposed to be a scientific Utopia predicated on scientific principles and all of that and you know it just didn't work
Anyways
so I kind of buy Hume's argument
that you cannot derive an ought from an is now
that's a problem
first of all it's a problem because you have factual knowledge but you don't know how to implement it you know it's like
should you spend money on AIDS or should you spend money on cancer or should spend money on higher education
how the hell are you going to calculate that rationally
you can't because you just don't have the  information at hand
It's not possible to
you know I worked for a U.N. committee at one point and the U.N. committee had like a hundred
proposals for how the world could be improved but there was no order to them it's like it wasn't this is more important than this it's like well
that's the end of that you know you have got to start with something and so that means you have to make something
more important that other things obviously in your life
if everything is of equal importance then you are paralyzed
Now you know it's a truism
and probably an oversimplfied one that
since the dawn of the scientific revolution
a wedge has been driven through the heart of our societies such that the moral systems that we
use to unite us
so those would be religious systems fundementally
have been subject to an intense critique from the scientists and
you know it's a pretty effective critique
even if you have maintained a traditional faith it's like
the scientific onslaught is no joke
and that's a problem as far as I can tell because
and the problem is that you are still left with the problem of how you should act
and Nietzsche the philosopher Nietzsche he would say that
we are running on the fumes of Christianity in the West
because over it's thousand years of domination let's say 1500 years of absolute domination
it produced a consensus of morality that was predicated on metaphysical presuppositions
and that organized societies
and those societies are predicated on certain beliefs like the belief in
really I would say in something divine inhabits each individual
you know that sort of the presumption that is embedded in law sort of the idea that underlies
the idea of natural rights right
there is something about you that is so valuable that even the law
has to bow to it even if you are reprehensible even if you are convicted and reprehensible
Now that's man
the idea that people came up with that idea that's a bloody miracle you know because
generally speaking
your proclivity is that if someone is being even accused of doing something  the general human proclivity
is that if someone is just been accused of doing something terrible that's enough so that you can
stone them to death or do whatever you are going to do with them
presumption of innocence before guilt good God
of all the things that aren't automatic that's got to top the list
you know it's unbelievable that occurs and it is interesting to me because
it seems to me that that presupposition that there is something valuable transcendent about each individual
I wouldn't call that a scientific presupposition but
it seems to be a highly functional presupposition right
I think in that
it isn't unreasonable to notice that societies that have valued the individual
and made the law subject to the individual even with regard to voting
because that's basically what voting does it puts sovereignty the hands of the people
those societies actually seem to work
Now whether they will work for the next 300 years
who the hell knows but they work pretty well for the last 500 years let's say
We've got it pretty good right now and you know I suspect most of you
are rather pleased that the law recognizes you value  as individuals
and you take that for granted right you think you have rights
and of course the rights you have natural rights are
logical consequences of your
transcendent value and that is nested in this is Nietzche's observation
that is nested in a set of metaphysical beliefs
and his idea was that if you wipe out
wipe out the metaphysical beliefs
eventually you wipe out the whole system because you have knocked out the cornerstone
and it might take a long time for the thing to shake
and fall but it will
now whether he was right or not is hard to say
it looks to me like what has happened since Nietzsche announced the death of God in say
the late 1800's is that
Western society has oscillated between extremes
you know extremes on the right
Germany
extremes on the left
and you know with the democracies at least the other democracies
the democracies managing to stay the course somewhere down the middle
but it is not obvious to me that that can be maintained without the underlying metaphysics
and that is a problem because
whatever you might say about the underlying metaphysics
it is not true the way that science is true
and that could be OK because there might be more than one form of truth in fact I think there is
I think that there is pragmatic truth and
I think that pragmatic truth is actually deeper than scientific truth
and pragmatic truth is the truths that enable you to act in a manner that best
that improves the probability roughly speaking of your existence  and reproduction maximally
that is a Darwinian idea one of the things about the Darwinian theory
this kind off puts it in opposition to scientific materialism I would say is that
the Darwinian theory is that you do not have privileged knowledge of the world
and you can actually tell that because you die
if you knew enough about the world you would not die and you do die
and so you are embodied theory of sorts
and that theory is good enough to get you along about 80 years and
produce some reasonable probability that you'll have children and that they will survive that's it man that's what you have managed after
3 billion years of evolution
it's a good enough solution
it's a good enough way of acting and we don't know a better way of acting and
our world conceptions are actually nested inside the Darwinian system
and  they might be predicated on pragmatic truths
rather than objective truths pragmatic truths are truths that have functional utility
and we are alive we care about being alive
we tend to use our theories as tools
it's possible that our theories are tools
and that they are tools to help us stay alive
Now I was reading a bit about Camille Paglia the other day
and ah
I have noticed some similarities between she's a famous
gadfly I would say of feminists
classic modern feminists although she would regard herself as a feminist
Unbelievably smart like if you want to watch someone whose
verbally
Who has verbal mastery beyond belief
You could watch Camille Paglia she seems a little manic to me she can
rap off an argument at a rate that's just mind-boggling and is very coherent and
she tends to shred her opponents in arguments she is so brilliant
She said something interesting and she has been influenced by some of the same people I have been influenced by she liked this book
by Erich Neumann called  The Origins and History of Consciousness which
I would recommend if you are interested in Jungian theory Carl Jung
It's a good introduction to Jungian theory and it's about the development of consciousness
and
It's predicated like Jung's work and Joseph Campbell's work
and Mircea Eliade's work all which has been criticized or ignored by the post-modernists
Predicated on the idea that human beings have a central narrative
and that
that central narrative is
the
dramatic expression of
the necessary  human system of values
and that is built into us
it's part of our nature we have a nature as human beings
we're not infinitely malleable by culture
which is a post-modernist claim and a dangerous one
It's dangerous if we have a nature
Paglia has this idea that
the reason that you come to university and you study the humanities or the proper reason if you do that
is not to
engage in premature and destructive critisism
of something that you don't even yet understand
but to
learn as much as you can about
art and literature and poetry
and drama
and fiction
and religious thinking
and this all kind of a you can think about it as a
What is that?
What is all that? It's art
it's culture music belongs in that category
and like what the hell what about music it's like everyone loves it or almost everyone
It's a mystery
you listen to music and it is very meaningful
I mean music gets people through some pretty dark times why?
It's not obvious that for sure
you know and in most cultures music plays a very central role in identity formationand
you guys I think you will probably find as you age that your favorite music
will be the music that you listened to between the ages of 16 and 20
It's kind of like it imprints on you
and it defines a maybe it defines a generation
and maybe in our tribal past and this is highly likely
When you were being inculcated into the tribal culture
That was inculcated with dance and with masks
and with music all at the same time so you are invited to participate in this drama
and to take your place in this drama
and to think of that as a representation of the objective world is just not right that isn't what it is
It's an invitation to a drama
now then the question might be well is the drama real?
and the answer to that is
It depends on what you mean by real.
I think that great dramas are more real than real they're hyperreal
They're
They're hyper real because they provide guidelines about how to act that are abstract
and even perhaps generic but applicable across an extraordinary broad range of situations
So imagine this
you know you get up in the morning
you do a bunch of things
and someone asks you what you are doing what you did and you
you know you tell them well the first thing I did this morning was open my eyes
the second thing was think about whether or not I wanted to go back to sleep and then
you know I took off my blankets and then I put my feet on the floor
and I stood up and I was blinking while I was doing all this and I was also breathing
and then
you know I looked for my clothes and do you really want to listen to that guy?
You don't want to listen to that guy. It's like why are you telling me that ?
I want you to tell me something interesting.
Well what is it that is interesting? And why isn't that interesting?
It's not obvious.
So so then imagine the guy actually tells you a pretty good story a little adventure.
Probably
he was doing something normal something unexpected happened
he had to conjure up some new responses
he either settled the problem or he didn't settle the problem yeah you're interested in that.
Especially if he settled the problem because if he can tell you how
when he encountered some unexplored territory
he was able to sew it back together
then maybe you can do that thing happens and
that's pretty cheap wisdom for you he had to go through all the aggravation of
figuring it out and all you have to do is listen
you know and that's kind of a classic story the classic story roughly speaking is
There is a guy women doesn't matter
going about their life
relatively normally something blindsides them and they are in a state of
chaos
chaos is a place
chaos is the place that you end up when what you are doing
and the world stop matching and the chaos can be of different degrees  you know you could wake up and find that
your house was burgled you could wake up and find that a parent has
Alzheimer's or some fatal disease or that you do
or that your whole family was murdered or that there is a war starting you know
there are different degrees of chaos and
I think that you can
Quantify the chaos by calculating
how much of
what you do and expect is likely to be disrupted by the event
now because that the more disruption the more destabilized you are going to be which is why
if someone tells you that you are going to perish painfully in 3 months it's like
That's a bad one
you're really in an unexpected territory there nothing that you assumed that was real
roughly speaking in the world is real anymore
We like to watch people in their normal life
blindsided by something
experiencing this interregnum of chaos where they explore
and gather new information
and retool their character or retool the world because either of those would work as a solution
and then come out the other side
and things are better than they were to begin with
or at least as good but better is better that's a happy ending right?
That's a happy ending that's a comedy. technically speaking and so
what you want you want your life to be a comedy
not that it's supposed to be funny because
comedy doesn't have to be funny technically speaking
it's just the opposite of tragedy
tragedy is when you are going along pretty well and you get blindsided and that's that
and you know that can certainly happen it happens to people all the time. It's a comedy that you want.
Now
what I hope to provide you with
is a magic code
You know there was a book published a while back
Tom Hanks was in the movie
he was a Harvard professor who went around solving symbolic mysteries
Do you remember what is was called?
The Da Vinci Code every one liked that it sold a lot
and it was full of little mysteries it was full of hints that there was more to the world than
you think and which is definitely true
and that you know there is a way of getting access to that knowledge and it would be really worthwhile
and people like that idea and the reason for that is because it is actually it's true.
It's true
it's true like
like fiction is true so OK let's go back to the guy who is telling you about his morning
well he tells you something exciting
well then imagine that 10 people tell you exciting
and then you extract out the pattern of them dealing with this problem
from that and do then you have a that's what you do when you are an author
Right  because in a book you don't want the book exactly to be about
what ordinary people do in ordinary times in thier life
You already know hoe to be ordinary during ordinary  times of your life what that's not useful
you know you wouldn't watch a video tape of yourself
Imagine you videotaped yourself during a day and then the next day you watched that
It's like God who would want to do that
So what seem to happen in stories is that they distill
They distill
so they they watch people people watch people
and then they tell stories about what they see but they leave a lot out of those stories
Everything that is boring hopefully and then
more and more stories  about exciting things get
sort of aggregated and then maybe a great writer comes along and writes something really really interesting
profound character transformations
and then well you say That's fiction
and then you say That's not true
because it's fiction
but then then maybe that's not right
maybe it's more than true
because who wants the truth the truth is mundane reality and you have already got that mastered
What you want is the distillation of
interesting experience
and you might think well why is it interesting well that a really good question because you don't actually know
and believe me you really don't know because you will be interested in things that just don't make any sense at all
I am going to walk a bit today through Pinocchio and we will do that more the next time too
You know but I want to tell you a little bit about that movie to begin with just so you know how crazy you are
so you know the plot how many people have seen the Disney movie Pinocchio?
so lot's of people so
that's strange enough
in itself that so many people have seen it
and it's worth thinking about you know you tend to show your kids that movie
and but if you think about the movie it's
you are doing some pretty weird things when you are sitting there watching that movie man. First of all
it's drawings right and they are low resolution drawings
You don't care and you watch the Simpsons or maybe what's that called
the one that's been concentrating on political correctness so much
South Park!  God that animation man it's just awful
Right it is just horrible it couldn't be worse
you don't care like
Round heads smile
little bit of shuffling that's a person as far as you're concerned
it's just irrelevant and if it was higher resolution it wouldn't help
You just need the bare bones right
to hang your perceptions on
so you watch this drawing that's Pinocchio beautiful drawings
animated in a sequence
You are not watching something real you are watching a pure construction
and then you think about the plot it's like
It's completely absurd everything about it is absurd it's like
Well one of the characters is a bug
and he turns out to be like the conscience and so what the hell is with that?
and then another character is this puppet marionette and
you know somehow he gets free of his strings and then goes on this adventure and then
and then you know he gets enticed into
various nefarious places by a fox and a cat
and then he rescues his father from a whale
and you don't even know how his father got in the whale it's like the last time you see his father
he was in a rainstorm and the next thing that happens is he is in a whale
and you are sitting there thinking Hey no problem this all makes sense.
It's like what? really?
Why?
How does that make sense?
Well the answer is you don't know
That's the thing that is so cool
you don't know you don't even know what you are watching
but it doesn't matter
You watch it and you are interested in it you want to see what the hell happens to this puppet
You want to see if he ends up becoming a real boy.
because there's it seems important
Well you say Is Pinocchio true?
Well that's a stupid question.
It's partly a stupid question because the answer is it depends on you mean by true
and
it isn't obvious to me
what you should mean when you say that something is true
and the reason it is not obvious is because
We have this idea in our society and it's a very profound idea and that idea is that the ultimate truth is scientific truth
That that tells us about the nature of the world and it does that
in a final way in some sense there is no brooking any arguments about it
The physicists have got it right and that's why they can make hydrogen bombs and that's a pretty good demonstration of their being right
but you don't act as if that's true
and you don't
and you watch things and pay attention to things and are captivated by things
that aren't predicated on those assumptions
and it seems to me that There is a problem of what the world is made out of but there is a bigger problem
and that is the problem of how you should conduct yourself in the world
And that is what you really want to know people want to know that more than anything
Because you need to know it's like here you guys are in university you don't know what you are doing
I mean some of you know more than others
but you are at the beginning of your life and
life is very complex and chaotic and
It isn't exactly obvious you know what kind of relationship you should
form or what sort of character you should develop
or what you are going to do for a job or
what's the meaning of life that's a good one  what's the meaning of life
Well and you know people come to university at least many of them and that's kind of what they want to find out
Now Paglia her notion is that
you could think about it this way is that articulated knowledge
is embedded in inarticulate knowledge
and inarticulate knowledge is
a domain of literature and art
high culture let's say
and it's we sort of know what it means
but we don't know exactly know what it means it means more than we know
and then outside of that is what we don't know at all
and that's an idea that Jung developed as well and maybe Paglia picked it up from Jung
because Jung believed that
you know there was this domain that we had mastered
in every domain and then
there was domain outside of that you could think of as unexplored
territory and what we met unexplored territory with was our creative imagination
and what we were trying to do with our creative imagination is to
figure out how to deal with that unexplored territory we are producing dramas
that we could act out that would help us deal with what we still hadn't mastered
and outside of that there is just what we don't know at all
and Paglia's idea and this was Jung's idea was that
without understanding that surround
you are too atomized
you are not part of your historical tradition
you haven't incorporated the spirit of your ancestors
who built all this
you're just here now
and you don't know what to do either you don't know how to maintain your culture and you don't know how to serve it
you know you might say why should you serve your culture and
well I have a hypothesis about that you know
You can think about this I don't know if it's true but
People ask what the meaning of life is and it seems to me that
Meaning is proportionate to the adoption of responsibility
You know like let's say have
a little sister who's like three
you are going to take care of her
Questioning whether that is a good idea seems stupid
You know what I mean it just doesn't seem like the right kind of question
It's like well obviously
self evidently let's say that's what you do
and do you find it meaningful it's like probably
you know interacting with a little kid
when I had little kids you know when they were like two and under
we took them out to seetheir
relatives and they were older people
you know they watched that two year old like it was a fire
you know every second that that little kid was in the room
every single adult was
focused on focused on  on him or her
That is something that people attend to  and
that's a source of meaning and what else is meaningful well your family relationships are meaningful to you and
maybe the responsibility that you adopt as a friend that seems meaningful
maybe your decision to pursue a particular career and be of some utility
in society you know part of that's
governed by your desire to establish some security and get ahead it's fine but
You are also
playing an integral role in the maintenance of the structure that supports you and my observation has been that
in my clinical practices people just have a hell of a time if they don't have
if they don't slot in somewhere you know
You know I got to go to work at 9:00 in the morning and you know I have got this rigid schedule it's like
It's probably a good idea to be grateful for that because what I have noticed is that if people pull out from those externally
scaffolded systems
they drift
they get depressed they get anxious they don't know what to do with themselves you know they are kind of like sled dogs with no sled
and we are kind of like sled dogs as far as I can tell beasts of burden we need a load man we need a load
and the question is what sort of load do you need
and here is why I think we need we need that
I've been thinking about how to figure out what is real for a long time and
because I am an existentialist
I'm operating under the presupposition that you can tell what people believe by watching how they act
I don't care what they say
I don't care what their statements are about their view of reality
because the correlation the relationship between that and their actual actions is not
certainly not perfect and sometimes doesn't even exist
One thing that I've noticed is that people
no one argues with their own pain
Everyone who hurts
acts as if they believe that pain is real
So we could say the ultimate reality is pain
That's how people act
it's in keeping with the claims of many religious tradiations you know
The Jews are always recollecting past pain
I mean the Christian God is a crucified person I mean there is a fair bit of pain there for the Buddhists the fundamental maxim is that life is suffering
and it seems to me that there is a metaphysical claim there
the metaphysical claim is that pain is real
now of course it depends on what you mean by real
but people act as if their pain is real so that's a good place to start
Now that poses a problem
Life is a pain
Life is suffering let's say and why is that?
Well it's because you can be broken hurt and destroyed
So that seems pretty self evident and  worse you know it
and that makes people unique like that's our self conciousness right?
That's really what separates us in some sense from other creatures
I mean other creatures have some self conciousness like a chimp
can learn to recognize itself in a mirror and so can a dolphin but
You know that's pretty bare bones self conciousness you know
real self consciousness is the knowledge of your borders
and not only in space but in time
and as far as I can tell human beings are the only creatures that discovered the future
and that's really good because we can plan for the future but it's really bad because you know
the future is finite and that a big shock to the old system
and it's the existential burden that everybody bears and it is associated integrally with suffering
and so then you think well life is suffering and it's finite and that is part of the suffering
that's part of what makes you question the value of
existing and maybe the value of existance itself
So then what do you have to use as a weapon against that
Well you know we talked a little bit about responsibility that seems to work you know
The amount of responsibility that you adopt
in relationship to things seems to increase your meaningful engagement 
and you might say well what's the most meaningfully engaged activity 
and you might say well
How about a little reduction in the old suffering?
You know so you live your life so that
you are not causing undue pain especially pointless pain
that would be good and maybe you could even be more useful than that and you could figure out some ways that some suffering
yours other peoples both if you are really
hitting a home run maybe you can figure out some way that some of that could be rectified and that seems to be
meaningful in and of itself I mean if it's pain that makes you doubt the meaning of life which is perfectly reasonable
then this cessation of pain
the cessation of suffering the minimization of suffering
as a logical corollary should be the proper medication
and so I would say that means that
there is some mode
that you can conduct yourself in that makes you a good person
and
part of being a good person is
to alleviate suffering
and
I don't get think you get to question that actually if
if the suffering itself is what is making you question the validity of your life then
you can't also say that the cessation of that is not useful
I mean you can but it's completely incoherent you can claim incoherent things if you want
So then I would say
these distilled stories that I am talking about
the stories that are written say by great authors
I am particularly fond of Dosytoevsky
whose works are
he is head and shoulder above anyone I have ever read in terms of
writers of fiction he deals with the hardest questions that human beings face
and
he
he has characters on both sides of the argument and they're they really lay out the arguments
it's not like Dostoevsky has a belief so
he has a character and that character has his beliefs and that character always wins the arguments
that doesn't happen is a Dostoevsky novel at all
he sets up a character and then he sets up 3 or 4 antagonists
and those antagonists they are not straw men they're like iron giants
they just stomp his protagonist and the whole thing is a war between these
different conceptions of being it's amazing to see it's amazing to read.
so you distill these stories great authors distill stories
great storytellers distill stories
and we have stories that are very very very old
those are usually religious stories of one form or another but they can be fairy tales
because fairy tales some people have traced fairy tales back more than 10000 years
and so they are a part of an oral tradition
and oral traditions can last for tens of thousands of years and
You know a story that has been told for 10000 years is a funny kind of story it's like people have remembered it
and obviously modified it it's like the game of telephone where I tell you something and you whisper it to the person next to you and so on
It's like a game of telephone that has gone on for a thousand generations and
all that's left is what people remember and maybe they remember what is important because you tend to remember what is important
It isn't necessarily the case you know what the hell it means you don't know what music means
but you know
it doesn't stop you from listening to it
You don't know generally speaking what a movie that you see or a book that you read means
not if it is profound it means more than you can understand
because otherwise why read it
Well so the idea is this that
we are necessarily nested inside moral systems the moral systems are predicated on
narratives narrative dramas of sorts
and
the moral systems are what orients us in life
and the reason to understand them to the degree that you can
is because you need to know how to live
Nietzsche said that if you had a why you could bear any how.
and
that's good one of the things that the Auschwitz guards used to do to the prisoners
and this is very telling so at Auschwitz there was a sign that said
Work will make you free
it was a little joke
not really a very funny joke
It's the kind of joke that you have to be
satanic is the appropriate term to conceptualize
and to dare to
to state
so when the Auschwitz prisoners came to Auschwitz they were already pretty
pretty rough shape they were in cattle cars
they had been separated from their families everything had been taken from them
they were transported for a long time they were standing up
the kids suffocating because there was no room it was so packed in there
they didn't have anything to eat there weren't any toilet facilities of any sorts it was like
You got rid of 20% of the people just transporting them the one on the outside of the cars they froze to death because of course it was cold
and
pretty nasty
and when they got to Auschwitz the guards use to have this game that they would play
this is part of the work will set you free thing
They would get a prisoner take a prisoner
who is already in pretty rough shape
and then have them carry a sack of wet salt a 100 pounds
from one side of the camp
to the other
and when you think of a camp you think of something like a football field maybe something that big fences around it like no way man
these were cities there were tens of thousands of people in these places
so from one side of the camp compound to the other that was a good hike
and that wasn't bad enough they had to get them to  carry it back and put it the same place
Now
that's poetic in it's malevolence you know what you are doing is you're harnessing the human
compulsion to engage in useful activity
and demonstrating how absolutely futile that is despite it's difficulty
seems like a bad thing to do
people need
it's a parody of meaninglessness that's what that is
and you know people need meaning in their lives because their lives are difficult
and so  the question is
to what end should you devote your life
and another question might be does it matter
matter is an interesting word because matter is matter but matter is also what matters
and I would say that what matters is more than real than matter
at least that's how you act and then the question is well is there something that you should be aiming at
It's a good question that's the question of the meaning of life
and when one of the things that is supposed to happen when you come to university
is that the sort of question that should be addressed
and as far as I can tell
and this just might be my more cynical side what I see happening to university students generally speaking is that they come in
clinging to the wreckage of their culture
and
floating with the pieces and
those pieces are taken away by
professors who tell them that
everything can be deconstructed and no nothing has any real meaning it's like
when you are finally educated it's when floating out on the ocean and you've got nothing to
stay afloat with then you are done and you can graduate and it's like
I don't see that as useful
quite the contrary
So let me tell you a story
The first thing I am going to propose to you and we are going to talk a lot is that
you inhabit a story that the framework
through which you look at the world is actually a story and here is the story
The story is you are somewhere
and you are going somewhere
and that can be conceptual or whatever it's that
there is a gradient between where you are and where you are aiming at which means
no more really than you are doing something while you are sitting there
and hypothetically you are aiming for something better
and so you are in a state of insufficiency
always
the insufficiencies change
and then you are trying to rectify the insufficiency and
and you presume that your current state is less preferable to the state that you are aiming at
and then the way that you
bring those two together is sometimes you can do that through thinking
but fundamentally you do it through action
you do it through acting in the world and so that's sort of
that's sort of the answer in some sense to the mind body problem
you have a conceptual structure but when you implement it you're implementing
it not abstractly you are implementing through action so
that's the basic story it's not a very interesting story
but it's the framework through which you view the world so it's a value laden framework
Otherwise you wouldn't be able to act and you wouldn't know what to look at
so it's a value laden framework
you look at the world through a value laden framework so then we might say so what if the optimal value laden framework
That's what we are going to try and figure out.
now I told you about the war that went on between
the Communists and the West and how that obsessed me and
so one of the things that
I really wondered about was well was this just an arbitrary thing
You know like did the Communists they had some axioms and we had some axioms
so if you are a moral relativist you might say well
whose to say which set of axioms are better
or even whose to claim that you could say that a set of axioms one set is better than another
That's a moral relativist claim and you know fair enough!
So I thought that maybe this is just an arbitrary thing and it is going to be settled by force
Because that is how you settle an arbitrary claim between two competing systems
where there is no room for negotiation
So I thought about that for a long time I wanted to know
what the roots were of the Marxist system and what the roots were of the Western system and
what I surmised was that the Western system was actually something that evolved
whereas the Communist system was a rationalist construction that was imposed
and they weren't the same thing and so then I wondered well
what's Western culture grounded in and is there any reason to assume that that's real in any sense
and so
that's what took me into the study of the underlying stories
fundemental stories upon which our culture I believe is based and some of those are very old
I am going to tell you a Mesopotamian story it's one of the oldest stories we know I am going to tell you and Egyptian story
Those are sources of our culture
and I think that those stories are grounded in much older traditions
and I think that they refer to something real
actually real now
I already told you that
there are different ways of conceptualizing real
and that my initial hypothesis presumption axiom you might say is that
pain is the most real and the reason I believe that is  because that is how people act
Now you can criticize that
You can certainly come up with an alternate conceptual framework which the scientists have
because they believe that the most real thing is matter
maybe we need more than one set of tools to operate in the world
it's possible
So now I want to tell you what I think is the fundamental
constituent elements are of
stories
and one of the things that I hope is that
this knowing this will make you immunize you against ideology
and the reason I'm because I believe that ideologies are fragmentary
meta-narratives and they have their power because
they're grounded in the meta-narrative but they only tell part of the story
but they have power because they are grounded in the fundemental narrative
and so here is the fundamental narrative the characters let's say
we are going to say that people are prone to characterize the world we are social primates
we are social cognitive primates and we tend to see the world through the lens of a social creature
and so and partly because we're concerned with acting in the world and the world the world is mostly other people
then we conceptualize the ground of that
structure for action in characterological terms
so the the must fundamental reality is chaos
and chaos is what you don't understand at all
You can't even conceptualize it
you come into contact with it in bits and pieces
when the towers fell when the Twin Towers fell
chaos reigned for a few days everyone was shell shocked
and that was chaos and chaos is what you experience when your story falls apart
and that is a descent into the underworld
that's chaos and basically you live in order and chaos and order is where when you do
what you think you should do what you want to have have  happen happens
that is order that is explored territory
and chaos is when you do what you are supposed to do
to get what you want and it doesn't happen
and then that place that you are magically in when that happens that's chaos
and it has different depths you could say
it reaches all the way to Hell and that usually happens when
your life falls apart very badly
and you are down in that chaos and you realize that it was your fault
and that you did something wrong
and that you knew it and you ignored it
That's the worst form of chaos
So there is chaos itself and then
then the next thing is fairly straightforward you could think
there is the individual
the individual exists in culture
and culture is embedded in nature
pretty straightforward nature is Mother Nature for reasons we will get into
and culture is Father Culture
and I think that's because the fundamental dominance hierarchies
in human primates are masculine
and that Nature is assimilated to the feminine because it's
well for two reasons first of all females do the sexual selection among human beings
so that they are actually are nature from the Darwinian perspective
and second nature is the productive biological force
and so we have always conceptualized males and females and we used that conceptualization
to sort out the world
at large
it's a metaphor
but it's not just a metaphor it's reasonable to consider
culture as a judgmental father it's really reasonable because
you know
you have a group of people around you some friends some people that watch you work some judges
and that stretches across a very long expanse of time  and
those people as an aggregate make an entity that
is judging your reputation constantly
and it is perfectly reasonable to personify that because
it's like a metaperson that is watching you
and so it's a useful metaphor there is a metaperson that is watching you
Well yeah there is obviously
so now you could say well that's not real it's like
it's not real the way a scientific truth is real it is a different kind of real
Well nature has two elements destructive and creative obviously
there is the beauty of nature in it's bountiful element and there is
Anopheles mosquitoes and elephantiasis and cancer and
starvation and all the terrible elements of nature
and then there is culture and culture is tyrannical because
you have to shape yourself involuntarily even to get along with other people you sacrifice a lot of yourself and develop yourself but you sacrifice a lot of yourself
in that endeavor right we have to kind of average ourselves out in order to
to live together and some societies are more tyrannical that others
but there is always a tyrannical element you see that in university you know you guys know
that to some degree this is such a big place
it's easy to feel like a number here and that whether you are here or not doesn't matter
the institution doesn't care well that's the tyrannical element of it
now it does care because here you are and you are getting educated and all that
and so maybe that's positive
but it's got both these characters always have two sides
you know there's negative side and the positive side of nature
and there is the negative side and the positive side of culture and then there is the individual
so the individual is like standing on an island in the midst of an ocean
that's a good
imagistic conceptualization of your position
there is solid ground it has a limited expanse and outside of that is everything you don't understand
and you as an individual have a positive and a negative element as well
and that's the hero and the villain
and of course what good is a story without a hero and a villain
and the villain is the person who isn't acting like a person should act and the hero is acting like a person should act
and so when you go to movies and you read books and there are heroes and there is villians
and to some degree what you are doing is fleshing out your notion of a villain
you know you read about 30 villains and you think well there is something villainous about the villains
that is the central element of villainy
whatever that is
and you can imagine you construct out a metavillain
and a metahero and those are the characters in
religious stories generally speaking
you know and in the Marvel movies
there is Odin and Odin has two sons
right Thor and Loki and Thor is like
Thor is the world redeeming hero and Loki is the trickster who wants to bring everything down and
you have to recognize that in yourself
or it's useful to because otherwise you underestimate
[student entering] Is this positive psyche?
No it's Maps of Meaning
Positive psyche[laughter]
It's definitely not that[laughter]
Why might you be villainous?
Well first of all because you can be
that 's a big deal
you can be it's actually an offshoot of empathy
this is something that took me decades to figure out
I figured it out when I was studying the book of Genesis
because in the book of Genesis
people become self conscious and they immediately have the knowledge of good and evil
I just couldn't figure that out it's like what the hell is the relationship between that
and then really I tell you I thought about that for like 30 years
trying to puzzle that out and then I realized what it was
If you are self conscious
you can conceptualize yourself as a being
you know that you are
and you know what you're like
and you know what hurts you and what doesn't
and soon as you know what hurts you
you know what hurts her
and so that is the knowledge of good and evil that comes along with being self conscious
this is something that distinguishes human beings from every other animal
you know a lion will eat you
but it doesn't really want to tear you apart slowly
just for the fun of it
well it eats you it just wants to eat you
you know you could call that evil it sucks that for sure
but animals are beyond good and evil in that sense but human beings man
we can aim our malevolence and we are really good at it
because we can imagine God this would hurt and if it hurts me man it's really going to hurt you
so and you need to know that you are like that because you are like that
and it you don't know that you are like that or if you don't think that you are like that
you are more even like that than you think
because the people who are most like that are people who don't think that they are like that at all
and you have to contend with that
and that's why in many systems of thinking the world is conceptualized as a battle between good and evil
and it's an appropriate conceptualization
it's a meta-conceptualization and the culture is the wise king and the tyrant and that's always the case
and you are always stuck with that because as an individual with your negative and your positive side
your negative side is the resentful side that is
irritated and the limited conditions of being
and the suffering that entails and it's arbitrary and unfair nature
and no wonder like you got that side has a case to make
and it is not trivial
In the Brothers Karamazov that argument is laid out
beautifully there is a character Alyosha who is a monastery novitiate and not really a sparkling intellect
but a very good person and he has a brother Ivan and Ivan is a vicious genius
and Ivan just takes Alyosha apart and partly does that by telling a story about
Dostoyevsky took this from a news story
the news story was that this mother and father had taken their young daughter and
locked her in the outhouse overnight
when it was 30 below and she stayed out there crying and screaming and froze to death
and Ivan basically said to Alyosha you know
A world in which that could happen should not be
It's a good argument you know and you can multiply that by millions of examples
so the part of us that is opposed to being and resentful
it's got a point man
the problem as far as I can tell is that if you act that out
then it makes what you are objecting to worse
now you might be happy about that and
you might think well people couldn't be consciously
pursuing that but yes they can
I would recommend a book called Panzram if you are interested in that sort of thing
it's a book written by a man who raped 1200 men and killed dozens
and burned things down to the ground every chance that he got
and tried to start a war between England and the U.S. and
who was aimed at nothing but mayhem
and he wrote an autobiography at the request of a doctor
who had befriended him and he tells you exactly what he did and why
this story
hero and adversary
order and tyranny destruction and creation
that's the basic landscape and outside of that chaos and so let's take a break
Here is another way of looking at this idea
the individual is the person who pays attention and explores and masters or who looks away
and the the person who inhabits an explored territory
and this is unexplored territory
and so wherever you go there is you and the half the two halves of you
that you have to contend with and
wherever you are with people there is the society with it's tyrannical and beneficial nature
and the society in some sense is that match between what you are doing and what's happening
it's really important to get that right and unexplored territory that where ever
and whenever what you are doing stops working
and so it's not exactly a geographical idea you know because when you think of explored territory
you think of geographic landscape like the domain of an animal like your house
and you know that's
that's definitely and element of it  but you know
if you're in your house and a snake comes into your living room and you are in there it's like well
that's an important difference between your house 1 second ago and your house now
and so your house can turn into unexplored territory at the drop of a hat and that is because we live in space and time
and so the unexplored territory is conceptual it's a conceptual
territory and it's just wherever you are when things aren't working
for you the way they are supposed to be
and so and these are permanent parts of the human experience
which is why I think that they are fundamental characters in our narratives
there is always you
there is some subject of the story
and that subject is an ambivalent person with many different potentials and
you are always somewhere
with other people because that's our territory right I mean
we are social beyond comprehension
and you know even our primate ancestors most of their territory
was other primates and their brains and our brains are specialized to view the world as an aggregation of personalities
It's really important to us and so we tend to view the whole world that way
and then unexplored territory well
that's where you don't know what to do
and but you know you do know what to do when you don't know what to do
peculiarly enough it's rather non-specific it's this generalized stress response and so what happens is
you freeze roughly speaking if the threat is enough then
you produce a lot of cortisol and a lot of adrenaline so that you're
bloody well ready to move quick in whatever direction you have to
and then maybe you pay more attention
and that's what you do when you don't know what to do and the problem with that is that you can stay in that state forever man
that is kind of what post traumatic stress disorder is it's like
you are just like that all the time
and the problem with that is it's very uncomfortable I mean
You stay like that for any length of time you are going to get depressed
you are going to develop an anxiety disorder you are going to get old
because you're burning up resources like mad you know
your system is shunting everything to maintain that
state of emergency preparation and
it's exhausting
it's not where you want to be
so that's partly why people are so prone to
defend their territories their familiar territories because
if their familiar territory is invaded or disrupted
then they default back to this state of emergency preparation and that's like
that can unglue you if it's profound enough
you know and you guys know this already I mean
I think that people experience this most particularly
when they are betrayed by someone they have an intimate relationship with
you know when they are lied to
there are other ways
the collapse of a dream or a vision that you've been pursuing or
an illness or the death in a family there are lots of other ways but betrayal is a really good one
because if you are with someone for a long time you trust them
you have a representation of your past you have a representation of you in the relationship
you have a representation of them you have a representation of relationships
you have a representation of the future
you get betrayed it's like poof even the past isn't what you thought it was
you know and what about you
How clueless are you ?
and maybe not at all or ultimately gullible you don't know is it your fault?
are you so clueless that just can't protect yourself or
was the person malevolent in some subtle way that you failed to detect
everything is up in the air
not good and this idea that human beings
travel to the underworld and come back it's a really useful thing to understand because
we do that all the time
whenever we fail it's like whoop down into the underworld for a while
where everything is in chaos
and then maybe we sort ourselves out and bang we are back up
and so one way of conceptualizing yourself is not
as order and not as chaos
but as the thing that traverses between the two domains
and that I would say is mythological hero
so I am going to start talking to you about Pinocchio a little bit
weirdly enough
I hope you enjoy this
and the reason I want to do it is because I want to put some
I want to bring what I told you abstractly
down to earth
and then you can start thinking
well do the conceptions that I have introduced to you are they good for anything
do they help?
that's the order
descent into chaos reestablishment of order
that's paradise lost profane history
paradise regained it's the classic comedy
and that's the story of life
and so
the question is how do you manage it?
and so
that's a question you really want to know the answer to so you will go
you will pay money weirdly
you'll line up and pay money
to see a story about that even if you don't even know what that stories about
and the reason
for that actually part of you does know what the story is about
you know you have your cognition has multiple layers
you understand things
that you don't know that you understand
in ways that you don't understand and you can tell that because you know
we talked about Pinocchio a little bit how absurd it is
and that it doesn't matter well
[Student]  I have a question so we have been talking chaos is when people don't do what they
expect you to do in a negative sense something bad happens to you.
what if the reaction is extremely positive like something thatlike winning the lottery
Do you also go into the stress response or?
So it would be the same thing
[JBP] No it's not quite the same thing it's a good question and we will address that
we will address that
I mean winning the lottery is generally not a good idea for people you know because it's just too much
it's too much for them
flips their lives upside down
they tend at best to return to their original baseline level of emotion
but yes something remarkably good
I mean it's a lot better that something remarkably bad obviously but it
still can have that destabilizing effect
so depends on what elements of your life it disrupts
like in some sense you have a map that you are operating within in the world
and that map is predicated on assumptions of different sorts
some shallow some profound
when the profound assumptions are devastated
huge chunks of the map are invalidated and that can happen sometimes when dramatically positive things happen as well
so but the fundamental rule is the more of your axiomatic presuppositions
are disrupted the harder it is on you
you know like maybe you quit your job because you won the lottery
Hey I am off to the beach I am going to drink margaritas
it's like that will work for about four days
you know you do that for three months you are a beach alcoholic it's like that's a real improvement
you know so it's not that easy often too if you take people out of their routine
you know they just flounder
their circadian rhythms go they don't eat properly they don't know what the hell to do
you know so this is often why people have such a hard time when they retire
I am going to retire and relax it's like
if I relaxed for two weeks I would die
you know I need something to do
I need to be engaged in something
so OK
Pinocchio Disney movie an early one a masterpiece
so I am going to walk you through it
and I am going to tell you
what I think it means and
and you can tell me if you think that that is useful
and I am only going to do that for about ten minutes today because I do want to cover some of the details
of the class and then next class we will continue with this so
So the movie opens with
the opening credits
which are carved wooden signs which is like a hint you know
because Geppetto is a carver and it starts with this song
which was actually quite a popular song
and it's a bit of a
what would you call it
I don't think that it's
the poetry is particularly profound
but it was a song that people liked and people still listen to and
It's sets the tone for the movie which is what music does
one of the things that is really interesting about movies that's really mysterious is that
you know
if you go to a movie there is almost always a soundtrack
right if you go to movie and there isn't a soundtrack
it kind of feels empty it feels like there is something missing and
you know it's as if the music
You know when you go to a movie there is lots of things you can't
see the characters are only partial and
you don't know anything about there background so it's like a low resolution thing
and what seems to happen with the music is that it's provides the emotional background
the complex context let's say it's like a substitute
for the context and it guides you in your in your perceptions of the movie
it gives you hints about what is going to happen and
and the funny thing about that is that we just don't have any problem with that you know it's like yeah of course a movie has a soundtrack
and of course when there is a dramatic scene the music gets dramatic and
but that doesn't happen in real life
so you would wonder why we would accept it in a movie and
I think it is partly because we are willing to accept the amplification of reality
that constitutes a movie
and in fact we find that compelling and music is one of the things that does that amplification
the dramatization and that's that's acceptable to us
This song I find quite interesting so I am going to take it apart quite a bit
in some sense I feel foolish doing it because it's you know it's a childish
it's a childish song in some ways
but
but that's OK When you wish upon a star it makes no difference who you are
well OK there's some mysteries there
people wish upon stars that's like a little ritual right
Why
do they do that?
well
and what is exactly is a star
that's another question because
there are stars that shine in the heavens
and there are people who are stars
and so
Why are people stars?
Well they are usually famous people right they are people that
who attract a lot of attention
and maybe they are people who who have a lot of talent  that's a possibility
Maybe they are models I don't mean clothing models although sometimes they are they are models for emulation
that's what being a star means that's why People magazine is full of stars
it's like they're heroes brought to earth
and of course you know nothing about them all you know is their public persona
and of course they are usually very attractive and so
that allows you to project upon them all the things that go along with ideal humanity
and so they are stars
and but still why stars? well stars beckon in the darkness right?
and they are other worldly
that's the thing that's cool they are not of this earth
and I mean that
technically because obviously they are not of this earth but I also mean it
I mean it
phenomenologically I mean it as an element of human experiance so
most of you are urban
and so you have not had the experience of
perhaps of the full night sky and you know that is really to bad because
the full night sky is one of those experiences that actually induces awe
naturally you know and no wonder
you look up there and there are just stars everywhere
right you are looking at the edge of the galaxy that's actually
that's the Milky Way right it's the edge of the galaxy it's like wrah!
Wow! There is the edge of the galaxy
and there is just so many of them and it's such an expanse you are looking into infinity
you are looking into the unknown you are looking beyond yourself
that's for sure
and you know that produces a sense of awe in people like looking at the Grand Canyon or something like that
and it's you are looking at something that transcends yourself but that feeling of awe that seems to be something that's
that's a natural part of our response
and you know you might feel awe when you meet someone that you regard as particularly admirable as well
because you feel that there is something transcendent about them
Here is an interesting thing to think about
There are people you admire
and there are people you don't admire
and that's a clue right that's a clue as to your value system and
it might be not something that you can really put your finger on it's like you find this person captivating you find this person
admirable
and it's as if there is something inside of you that is looking for what is admirable
you know assuming that you are
and that person who is admirable has a faculty some faculty
that you would like to have for yourself
and so they are a model for emulation
and that's part of how people develop you know like little kids often develop little hero crushes on older kids
you know not that much older but sort of the person that is just within their grasp
and then they follow them around and imitate them and
So they are imitating what they find admirable well
The fact that you find something admirable is a hint as to the structure of your unconscious value system
and so you could think even as an exercise you could think
what qualities of a human being do I find admirable you have to ask yourself that in a sense
you can't really think about it there is a difference between asking yourself a question and thinking about it
You know because it's more like when you are asking yourself a question it's contemplative
Well what do I find admirable?
It's a question you don't know and
if you are fortunate and this happens quite regularly an answer will float up from wherever the hell answers float up
and Oh yeah that's one and you can write that down
you get some idea of what your ideal is you know and and you have one likely
and what your counter-ideal is
Star
Well to wish upon a star is to raise your eyes above the horizon
and to focus on something transcendent that is beyond you
to focus on the absolute we could say to focus on the light that shines in the darkness
Now a star is
People wear diamonds because they are like stars
or they are like the sun
and they are pure and perfect and they glitter so there is something about the light too
there is something about a source of light
It's a source of illumination and enlightenment
and the light that shines in the darkness is a deep metaphor right it's
it's what you want you want a light to shine in the darkness
and so the star has all of that and so people wish upon a star
because they have some intuition that aiming above the mundane
has the potential to transform themselves they make a wish well
If you are going to
make a wish you should aim at something high!
and even just aiming at that is more likely to make the wish come true and this is not
metaphor
you know I have this program which you guys are going to do
called the future authoring program
it's one of two assignments one is that you write an autobiography
that's the past authoring the other is that you write
a plan for the future that's the future authoring I would recommend that you get started
on those right now like not right now but really soon because they are harder than you think
and some of you are going to write like 15000 words
you are going to get sucked right in this happens all the time you are going to get sucked right into it
and so
you write an autobiography because you need to know where you are
and who you are right now  because how the hell are you going to plot a pathway to the future unless you know where you are
and then you need to write about the future because
you aren't going to hit something unless you aim at it
that's for sure
and lot's of times people won't aim at what they want because they are afraid
the reason they are afraid is because if you specify what you want you have specified your conditions of failure
you know when you fail
and it is better to just keep foggy it's like well I don't know if I am succeeding or failing but
you know I can't really tell. Well great! Except you can't hit anything you don't aim at
and so the future authoring program is like a
it's an attempt to have your articulate you character
and so is the past authoring program.  Who are you?
and you know the past authoring program asks you to break your life into
epochs and then to write about the emotional you know the things that you regard as important
Important events that have shaped who you are and
you know you may find that some of those some of that writing makes you emotional and I would say
if you have a memory that is more than 18 months old roughly speaking
and when you bring it to mind it has an emotional impact
especially a negative emotional impact
it's like part of you soul is stuck back there
and I know that that's a metaphorical way of thinking about but what I mean is that
The reason that you still experience the emotion is because you have not solved the problem that that situation
faced you with and it might be a real problem like maybe you got tangled up with someone
who was really bad and that's rough man because you have got to come up with a theory of malevolence to deal with
something like that and that's no joke
but if its still producing emotion that means you have not solved the problem and
your brain is still tagging it as threat it's a part of you territory that you did not master
threat threat threat threat
and until you take it apart and articulation really helps that writing really helps that
then you are not going to free yourself from it's grip
and that what might not be that pleasant I mean this one of those situations where doing it
tends to produce a decrement in peoples mood
in the short term but quite radical improvements 3 to 6 months down the road
you know it is often the case that you unfortunately have to do something you don't want to do in order to progress
it's very very common
so and the future authoring program asks you about different dimensions of your life
Like because you're you can think of yourself as a personality inside your head but
you are nested in systems that transcend you and they are just as real as whatever is in your head its like
Well what do you need for life?
Well that's pretty easy actually some friends
that's a good thing intimate relationship that's a good thing
a family you know either the one you are going to produce or the one that you come from where people
to some degree love and care for one another that's a good thing to work on
You need you need some plan for your career you have got to fit in somewhere that people regard as
important and that they will trade with you so that you can live
you need something worthwhile to do with the time that you are not at work
and you need to pay attention to you mental and physical health
and you need to regulate your use of substances
which is a strange one but alcohol does lots of people in so it's worth thinking about so that's why we put it in there
So then it's like what the hell do you want?
What do want from your friends?
What do you want from your family?
What do want from your career?
If you could have what you wanted and that's what the program asks you
3 to 5 years down the road you get to have what you want
Now I am assuming that you are going to approach this like
reasonable adults and not like 13 year old dreamers I think I want the most expensive yacht in the world
It's like fine but you know
that isn't really what it's supposed to be more concentrating on your character
and so then it asks you to write for 15 minutes without thinking too much about grammer
or sentence structure or any of that
about what your life could be like in 3 to 5 years down the road if
if you were treating yourself like someone you cared for
and you were helping them figure out what they wanted
and then it asks you to do the same thing in reverse
which is to think about
the ways that you're radically insufficient and your faults
and everyone knows this I think you know maybe not
but everyone has a sense of
if they were going to degenerate how they would do it
you know some people would be an alcoholic some people would be a street person and it's like
there is some doom thing out there that is
got your name on it if you are particularly incautious  and
you know don't
and let things fall apart so want you to write about that
what do you not want to have happen in 3 to 5 years
and there is psychological for this one is
If you have something to aim for that's a source of positive emotion
because your positive emotion is mostly generated by evidence that you are moving towards something that you value
it's not generated so much by accomplishing something
because when you accomplish something you are just left with the problem of whatever you are going to do next
so you graduate from university it's like
you know hurray!
one day you're at the peak of undergraduate university career the next day
you are unemployed and looking for a bad job at Starbucks
so you know
well you see what I mean you know it's that
you know one problem that you solve is replaced by another problem
and so the idea that you are gong to be happy when you solve all your problems is like
Hahaha! Good luck with that theory
but but
you know if you are aiming at something worthwhile and you really believe that it is worthwhile
and you have thought it through you know so that you are not weak you are not weak you've got your damn arguments mustered
then when you make progress even a little bit you think hey that's alright and you get a little kick
a little dopamine kick
and that's what you want because that's where your positive emotion comes from
you can use cocaine if you want but
ha but that tends to have relatively
detrimental medium to long term consequences
but it activates the same system so you have to aiming at something
and you should be aiming at something that's
realistic
that you want
that you could get you know like not easily
because if it's easy in some sense you have already got it
it's got to push you  and that's part of the pleasure actually because
there is two things that want to do when you are pursuing something that is important
and one of them is to get the thing that is important
but the other is make yourself better at pursuing things
so you can get both of those at the same time
you're aiming at something and increasing your competence at the same time
it's like that's a good deal that's a good deal and
there is a lot of intrinsic meaning to be felt in that and second half of the program
you write out a plan for how you are going to do it and how you are going to keep yourself on track
and you are going to write about why it would be good for you if you did this
and why it would be good for your family
and what possible benefits it would have to the comminuty
and. you know because you want to nail this thing down and then you want to
figure out what kind of obstacles are going to come up and how you might overcome them
and how you might keep yourself on track and all of that
We know because we have actually done a lot research on this particular program
if university students do this and this is more true if they're not
to well oriented to begin with
if university students do this they are
about 25% less likely to drop out which is a lot
and about their grade point average increases about 20%
so Hurray for that because you never know when you develop an intervention if it's going to work
there is also evidence but not from my lab
that doing such things improves your physical health
and I think the reason for that is is that when you go over your autobiography
and you scour out those negative places that you are sort of dragging along with you
it lowers your overall stress load
because your brain is kind of I think it is calculating how dangerous the world is
by attending to the ratio of
successes to failures that you have had in your life something like that and so
you know if there are holes in your map that you could still fall through
then your brain regards the territory still as a bit on the dangerous side
and then you are more prepared for emergency action and that hard on you so
you want to go back there and fix up those
experiences to the degree that you can
Now
those are going to be peer rated
now that's complicated but here's how you do it
write the thing so that you
have written it for you
and then take everything out that you are not
comfortable sharing with other people
and so there is a couple of reasons that I do it that was
one is just there is just no other way to do it
because
if I want to do this with you
the grading load is too high to do it
so I thought well it is still worth doing and because this is a class about narrative and about self narrative it's the right thing to do
and most of you are graduating soon and it's like
it's helpful I think that you will find it very helpful that is what students report
You'll each read
Three people will read each of your
offerings and give you a grade and then you get the average of the best two grades
and they are supposed to provide you with constructive feedback
constructive feedback is sort of mostly what did you do right
and maybe some hints about where you could flesh it out and all that
but so that's that and you need to write an essay
this is all detailed on the website
and that's the website if you go to jordonbpeterson.com on the left there is classes
if you click classes you get a bunch of tabs and one of the tabs is Psych 434 and that's obviously this class
there is some extra readings on there
and a list of how we are going to go through the course
the dates aren't right I have got to update it and I haven't finished that yet but
the rest of it is pretty much the way it is
This writing program is an online program and it guides you through the process of doing it but really
I would really recommend that you start
like this week
because it also works better if you do it over time and it seems
like in bursts of writing you know
and to sleep between episodes because that's when your brain consolidates its new information
and I would say do it meditatively
you know ask yourself
ask yourself it's a different way of
it's really funny when you ask yourself questions because part of you will answer
and you don't know what the answer will be
but and answer comes almost always and
you know like you think well what happened to me when I was six around six that was important
and through some mysterious process perhaps a memory will come to mind
there is a test
so there is these two
assignments plus the essay
it's an opportunity to
write about something that you want to write about
and there is a final exam and the final exam
if you read the book and come to the classes you will not have any problem with the final exam because it's not
it's not tricky it's just a survey of what we have gone through
and so I did that I didn't have that to begin with but
you know you need a carrot and a stick because you guys are busy and
you know you are going to triage
and do the things that are crucial and perhaps not the things that aren't and no wonder so
I had to make this crucial because otherwise you won't read it
and that's partly because it is hard
and so hopefully the course lectures will help guide you through it and
and that's about that
So I am going to tell you about a bunch of stories and I am going to try and explain what they mean
and what I hope will happen is that
the world of narrative will open up for you and that
and like I found that incredibly useful it's incredibly useful
to understand
these things it situates you better and
it also helps you see what people tell me about this course frequently is that
it's something like
that they already knew what I am telling them
but they didn't know that they knew it
so it makes sense it clicks it clicks
and you know to me what that means is that you have the information
represented in you in action
in your procedures in your habits
and in your perceptual structures it's implicit it's the implicit you
and then
I can articulate in part what that
implicit you is and it fits click oh yeah that's what I am like that's what people are like that's what people are like
and so
well if any of that happened today during this lecture to you well then that's a good sign that you might
benefit from the course
if it didn't well you could try one more lecture and see what happens
but you know this sort of what the course is like and
if that's what you want then this is where you get it
Good to see all of you and I guess we are done right?
So I am going to briefly review some of what I told you last time
and then I am going to walk through as I mentioned I am going to walk through
the Disney movie film Pinnochio and which I presume most of you have seen
How many of you have seen it?
Yeah OK that's that'sso as I think I mentioned that is something in of itself right?
I mean the fact that you have all seen it means that it's an
production of cultural significance and because it's such a strange artifact
That's one way of looking at it it might be worth
trying to take it apart to understand why it is for example that you even understand it.
and so
I offered you the proposition last week that we
view the world as essentially through a narrative lens
and I believe that we view the world through a narrative lens
because the fundamental problem that we have to solve
as living creatures is how we should act in the world.
and
that means
how we should act to maintain ourselves
but also how we need to act in relationship to other people
and in relationship to the broader world in order to maintain our self across time.
so that's a complicated problem right it's not just how you survive
it's how you survive now and next week and next month and next year
and 50 years from now and maybe your  your descendants as well
if the culture is going to stabilize
and then not only you across all those time frames but you and everyone else across all those time frames
It's a viciously difficult problem
and so I would say that we have evolved mechanisms to solve that
I think that is self-evident in some sense because for example one of the mechanisms that
animals have evolved to deal with the problem of social being
even if they are not particularly social animals
is the dominance hierarchy right or you could call it hierarchy of authority or power because
I think that considering human
structures social structures as mere power
structures is a terrible mistake it's a terrible oversimplification
because power is no means the only like force is what I mean
force is not a stable way of solving the problem of how to live together across time
the question is what is the stable way of solving how to live together
across time and the really is the question and it's part of the question that
I am trying to answer
partly because it's a perennial problem right we face the problem of
how to organize ourselves in small social units
without undue conflict and then we face the larger problem
of how to organize ourselves into large social units without undue conflict and that conflict can be
absolutely devastating and and frequently is
so then I would also say that the first way of solving this problem isn't conscious
you see not at all
and you know
you may know and you may not know that there are
there are different forms of memory
right
really technically different forms of memory so for example
there is short term working memory
which is the memory that you use to hold things like telephone numbers in your active imagination
it decays very rapidly it's only 4 to 7 bits
which is why
well it's why phone numbers are were at least
7 digits long you know you can kind of
manage that as a loop that and then there is
episodic memory and that has two elements one is semantic and the other is episodic
it's what's the name of that
mmm someone said something
[Student] Procedural?
Yes well there is procedural memory and then there is another
the kind of memory that you use to represent your
experiences to yourself so let's say it is image laden and the other one is semantic
and semantic is your memory for facts and those are quite different so for example
procedural memory
that is how you ride a bike that is how you play the piano
that's how you play jazz music if you are in a combo
it's it's the memory it's a funny kind of memory because it is built right into you you know I mean
so is so is the kind of memory that you use to represent your own life but it is much more malleable is some sense
so what that means is that in your procedures
there is information that you don't know about it's patterned information that you don't know about
part of that is how to act
you know like when you walk into a social gathering
you don't really think through how you are going to act
you know how to act and if someone asks you
exactly what it is that you are doing and why you could formulate a story about it
but the probability that that it's the existence of that story that enabled you to act that way is zero because
you have to react way faster than that and so you know have social knowledge
built into your nervous system because you have practiced being a social being for a very long period of time
and of course then that social being has been shaped forever really it's the right way of thinking about it
Now we know that animals organized themselves into hierarchies
and we will say of dominance because it is more true the farther back you go in time
at least since the time of the crustaceans you know  when we split from out common ancestor 300 million years ago and so
and it's true for social animals and non-social animals so
even animals that don't live together in groups
have to organize themselves into a hierarchy
in the space they inhabit songbirds are a good example and they have dominance disputes all the time
partly that's you can hear them having their little dominance disputes in the spring when they are singing because basically what they are singing is
I am pretty damn healthy and I am ready to go and if you are another bird like me you had better steer clear of this tree!
and the dominance songbirds
you know they don't live together crows are social but don't most songbirds aren't
the dominance songbirds get the best nest
and the best nest is the one that doesn't get rained on
it's not to windy and it is close to food sources and
you know so they have the healthiest chicks and they attract the best mates and
like it is really important where you are positioned in the hierarchy even if you are not
like a flock or a herd creature now we are more like herd creatures so it's even more
it's even more relevant to us  but there is just no escaping
a hierarchical arrangement in social being
that is social being
and and and it is evolutionary ancient beyond conception so
300 million years ago there weren't trees you know I mean so the dominance hierarchy is older than trees
so that is really something to think about and then you know when you are thinking about the reality that shaped us
say from an evolutionary perspective but also from a cultural perspective
what you have to understand is that that the things that have shaped us most are the things that have been around the longest and so you could say
those are the most real things
and you can't even see some of them it's not like you can come in here and well it's not exactly true
you can't come in here and see the multiple dominance hierarchies that are at work
You can in a way because
the chairs are set up to face this way and I am facing that way and
that gives you some clues about the social order here and you take the cues instantly right
you come down you sit in the chairs you organize yourselves according to mutual expectation and that's part of your procedural knowledge
about how to behave as a social creature
now
that knowledge is really really deep and a lot of it is coded in your behaviour
now and in other peoples behaviour as well
and that's you know. that's the expectations you have of other people and of yourself and a lot of those are implicit right
so
when we are interacting there's there is a very large number of things that you just don't get to do
and you know that too and you won't do them and that way we can act as if we understand each other
even though we don't because you are really complicated
and I am really complicated and there is lots of situations where we might really be in conflict
but because we share a map of the culture the cultural expectations
it makes part of our it's built right into our perception
you will act out that set of expectations and so will I
and if neither of us can do that even if one of us can't we are going to stay we are either going immediately
devolve into conflict or we are going to avoid each other like the plague
and that's exactly the right thing to do
and so one of the really useful things to understand  and this took me a long time to formulate properly you know
you hear the terror management theorists for example and they have this idea that
your your meaning representation the story you tell about the world
regulates your death anxiety it's something like that
but that is not right I mean it is close to right and it is a smart idea
it came from Ernest Becker by the way who wrote a book called The Denial of Death which is actually quite a good book even though it is wrong
you know sometimes a book can be very useful
it can be usefully wrong and Becker's book is usefully wrong
because he thought that
it's the internal representation of your belief system
that regulates your anxiety and that anxiety is fundamentally
in the final analysis anxiety about death it's like well OK fine it is a reasonable
proposition but that isn't how it works you see
it isn't my beliefs that right now that are regulating my emotion
It is the fact that I'm acting out those beliefs which include implicit perceptions I'm acting them out
and so are you
and so what you're doing and what I expect more accurately what you're doing and what I want you to do
and the way I want you to react to me that's working!
so it's the match between my belief system and the way that everyone else is acting that is regulating my emotions
it's not the belief system
it's mediated by the social culture and you see if you understand this then
you understand more particularly why people
are willing to fight to the bitter end to protect their culture
it's not a psychological structure that they are protecting
it's a psychological structure and sociological structure simultaneously
so the social contract is
you have a set of expectations and I have a set of expectations
they are actually desires they are not merely expectations because as
living creatures we are desirous we don't just expect
and so you desire an outcome and I desire an outcome
and we agree to act in accordance with that
that's the social contract
and so people don't like having that disrupted
well it isn't because it psychologically destabilizes them although it does
it's because it actually destabilizes them
right if all of a sudden we can't occupy the same
specified domain of territory it isn't only that we are thrown into psychological disarray although we will be
it's that we will start fighting with each other like and that can kill you
it's no joke it kills people a lot like it happens
it can happen very easily that a cohesive social group can fragment along some fracture line
of identity let's say and all hell breaks loose
and you know that's what the Tutsi's and the Hutu in the in the in Rwanda
and those things can get out of control just so fast it's just unbelievable and so
and that wasn't death anxiety that was death that's a whole different thing
and that's the other thing that terror management people don't exactly get it's like
it isn't just that your culture and cultural beliefs protect you from anxiety
and say anxiety about death even it's that they actually protect you from death!
as well as protecting you from death anxiety I mean look
It's warm in here
it's cold outside
the fact that the culture is intact means that you are not outside freezing
that's a hell of a lot more fundamental in some sense than mere anxiety although
I am not trying to underplay the role of anxiety that's a major issue but
there is something that is a lot more fundamental at stake that mere psychology
so it's the match between your map of the world and  other peoples actions that regulates your emotions
and and it regulates it completely because
you know if someone in here starting acting seriously deranged
like brandished a pistol let's say
all of a sudden you would not be in the same place
at all
not a bit
and so what would happen well
chaos would happen
and chaos isn't just that you would get anxious that's not a good enough explanation
what would happen is a lot more complex than that what happens in some sense is that your body
and it does this it does this what would happen is that you would react the same way that a rat reacts to a cat
it's exactly that it's exactly that you would respond as if
a terrible predator had emerged in your midst
And so What is that reaction? Well it's not just anxiety
because when you encounter a predator
anxiety isn't the only thing that is useful that would just make you freeze that could be the worst thing you could do
freeze and well you are a pretty easy target
so you have to be prepared for a lot broader range of responses that mere mere
mere petrification
like how about a little aggression
that might be helpful you don't know it also might get you killed but
but maybe you could take the guy down and maybe that's a good idea
you know and and maybe you have to run so that's disinhibited as well
and maybe you have to think really quickly
and reflexively so that happens that's actively disinhibited I would say as well it's like
your whole being thrown into intense concentration on the moment
and you are burning up physiological resources like mad and so what will happen after something like that
if you don't develop outright post-traumatic stress disorder which some of you would
is that you'd assuming that the situation was brought under control
you would walk out of here shaking with your heart rate at like 170 and it would take you like
well it might take you the rest of your life
and maybe you would never recover but you could be bloody well be sure that it would take you the rest of the day
that's for sure!
and so
it's no joke when someone steps outside the confines of the social contract
right and that is kind of there is a philosopher named Hobbes
who I suppose in some sense was a centrally conservative philosopher as oppose to Rousseau
who is kind of his exact opposite
Rousseau believed that people were basically good
in their natural state so he believed that nature was basically good
and he believed that culture was what corrupted people
and so
Hobbes believed exactly the opposite he believed that in the state of nature let's say
every person was at every other persons throat
and the only thing that prevented continual chaos was the imposition of a
of a collective agreement that would be the social contract
that essentially governed how people would interact and that would keep that underlying chaos
at bay
and you know
my contention is is that Hobbes was correct and Rousseau was correct and
and I think that if you add Rousseau and Hobbes together you get a total picture of the world and that's really
I think the picture of the world that I am trying to  relate to you it's both at once it's like
well you can't just attribute human
malevolence and unpredictability to society
it's a non starter
it's like people built society so all you are doing is pushing the problem back it's like
where did it come from
well the society the society before
well then the one before that it's like well
you got to tangle up the individual in there at some point right because people created society
and so
you can't just blame human irrationality and malevolence on society
well and also it's it's ungrateful for God's sake it's like
society obviously also makes you peaceful part of the reason you are peaceful right now all of you is because
well you are not that hungry
you are certainly not starving to death you would be a very very different person if you were starving right now
you know or if you were enraged or if you were panicking or if you were terrified
because your future was radically uncertain I mean you are not just
any of those people right now you're
satiated and I mean that technically you're satisfied
none of your biological systems except perhaps curiousity
which is a rather pleasant emotion
are activated in the least
and you know because of that you all think that you are in control of yourself
but don't be thinking that that's just not right
you mean if you look at how the brain is structured for example
the hypothalamus which is a really important part of the brain it basically
it basically establishes the framework of reference and the actions
the framework of reference within which and the actions you take
in order to fulfill basic biological needs
so the hypothalamus makes you thirsty and the hypothalamus makes you hungry
and it makes you sexually aroused
and it puts you into a state of defensive aggression and
it actually also makes you explore
and be curious and all of that's hypothalamic it is an amazing structure
and then
and it's really small and it's right at the base of the brain
and you could imagine it as something that has tremendously powerful
projections upward throughout the rest of the brain into the
emotional systems and the cortical systems and all of that like
tree trunk sized connections you know metaphorically speaking and then
the cortex has these little vine-like tendrils going down
to regulate the hypothalamus
you know and when push comes to shove
man the hypothalamus that thing wins!
and so you know you get people now and then
who have a hypothalamic dysfunction and one of them produces a condition called
I can't remember it it's not dypsomania although it's like that it doesn't matter
it produces uncontrollable thirst
and so what will happen is that people that have this hypothalamic problem
will drown themselves by drinking water which you can do by the way
and so they just cannot get enough water
and there is not stopping them right
no more that there would be stopping you if you were suffering from raging thirst it's like
it's a happy day when the hypothalamus is not telling you what to do
and you know you live in such a civilized state that most of the time
roughly speaking you are tranquil and satisfied and
more or less you can imagine yourself as a peaceful
you know productive well meaning entity
but don't be thinking that's you would be if you were put in the right situation
because that's just not right at all
you know lots of times soldiers develop post-traumatic stress disorder because they go out on the battlefield
they are kind of naive they are young guys you know and
It is actually is worse if they are not that bright it turns out because having a lower IQ
is one of the things that predisposes you to post-traumatic stress disorder but anyways
they go out on the battlefield and they see what they are capable of under battlefield conditions and like
you know we have been fighting wars for a very long time
millions of years you know chimps basically have wars with other chimps
the troupes right because the juveniles will patrol the
perimeter of their territory and if they find other chimps from other troupes that they outnumber
they will tear them to pieces
like and chimps are really strong and so when I say they'll tear them to pieces I mean that literally you know
hey tear them to pieces
and Jane Goodall discovered that originally in the 1970's she didn't even report it for a while because
she was so shocked you know
she kind of assumed like most followers of Rousseau that the human proclivity for warfare was
that was something that was uniquely human
you know it had something to do with our
our unique self-consciousness or our intelligence or something like that
she had no idea that it was rooted that deeply
you know we split from chimps about  6 7 million years ago something like that and so
we were patrolling territory we were gang members
7 million years ago and you know
that's a minimum estimation because of course that ancestor
shaded back maybe 20 million years into
entities that were roughly primate like
and so territoriality and the proclivity to defend territory is so deeply embedded in us
it's like the control center for our whole brain
and so there isn't anything more important to us I would say than maintaining
the match between what we want to have happen and what other people are doing in response to our actions like that's that that's what we want
and as long match is maintained then our emotional systems and I would say that anxiety is probably primary in that regard
our emotional systems remain inhibited
they're on
they're ready
like a nuclear reactor rod are on
and the rest of the brain dampens them down but
it's like you don't want them to take time to start up man you want them to be on at a tenth of a seconds notice when it's necessary
and so you know that's kind of why well if you look at a wild animal
it's like its alert
you know it's ready to dart this way or that way especially a pray animal
instantaneously and it has reflexes built into it as you do
that will respond way before you're conscious
So for example if you happened to be walking down a trail and you detect something snake like in the periphery you will leap away
before even know that you leapt
and that's because it takes a fair bit of time to actually see a snake
by which I mean form a conscious representation of the snake
you know and maybe it takes a 1/4 of a second or something like that
or even longer
but it doesn't matter maybe it takes a tenth
a twentieth of a second a tenth of a second but the thing about the damn snake is that it's way faster than that
it's really fast that thing and it co-evolved with primates by the way
and so it can nail you way faster that you can look at it so you have
your eyes map snake like objects right onto your reflexes so that
the eyes go the eyes make you jump
and then they see after that yeah well now you can see that's no problem
now what I would say that what we do is that we live in a shared story
and the story is a way of looking at the world and it's a way of acting in the world at the same time
and that story has to operate within narrow parameters
and this is something that is extraordinarily important to understand
because and this is something I think that Piaget figured out Jean Piaget
figured out better that anyone else I think that he really got this right and
by the way one of the things that Piaget was trying to do
you never hear about how strange these great thinkers are
Piaget was a very strange guy and he was a
he was a hyper-genius he was offered the
curatorship of a bloody museum when he was 10 years old you know because he wrote this little paper
on mollusks which apparently was very good and
so they offered him the curatorship of a museum and his parents wrote back and said Well you know
no probably not because he is actually ten.
and so that was Piaget man the guy was a genius
and you know he was actually motivated by the desire to reconcile science and religion
that was actually was his entire motivation for what did you never hear that but that is the case
Piaget was very interested in how you produce structures that enable you to regulate yourself
because you are kind of like a a colony of strange sub-animals that have to figure out how to get along
so that you can sort of be one thing
you kind of learn that I would say between the ages of 2 and 4
as you are being socialized you know how erratic 2 years old's are I mean they are a blast and
and it's part because they are erratic it's like
they are unbelievably happy and then they are unbelievably hungry and then they really hot
and then they are really upset and crying you know and then they are really scared it's like
and all of that's just untrammeled so it's really fun to be around them especially when they are happy because they are just so happy
that it's just you know
you don't ever get to be that happy
and so it's nice to be around a 2 year old because you can kind of
feel that again you know and a lot of one of the horrible things about being a parent is that you spend a tremendous amount of your time making your child less happy and the reason for that is that positive emotion is very impulsive
you know because everybody says well you should be happy it's like
well no when you are happy you are actually quite stupid
and so because happiness makes you impulsive
happiness makes happiness says Hey everything is   really good right now get what you can while the getting is good!
as a like if you are hyper-optimistic manic we'll say
It's like every stock investment looks like a really good stock investment
and it's like you go out and spend all your money because
look it there's those wonderful things everywhere and you could do so great things with then and then
you know you spend all your money
and then you crash and think oh God my life is over you know because I just I just
spent all my money on all this useless stuff and it's all under the grip of impulsive positive emotion
you know and so.
when you're telling your kids to be quiet and settle down
it isn't because they're making a lot of noise being in pain
it's because they are running around like wild baboons having a blast! And
disrupting things like mad  you know and so well kids have to settle down you know like
Quit having so much fun!
and it's kind of awful that you do that but
but you do
and that's because
the emotions and motivations have to be brought into
like a relationship with one another within the person
so that you know
one thing I remember with my son who was quite
he is quite disagreeable by temperament
which is actually a good thing as far as I am concerned although it brings its own challenges
and so with my daughter when she was misbehaving she was pretty agreeable
and uh
you know if she was misbehaving I could basically just look at her
and she would just quit you know but my son it was like
that was just nothing you're looking at me it's like no that's just not going to go anywhere man
so then I would like tell him to stop and
that really wasn't having much of an effect either
he would just sort of maybe laugh or run away
or whatever he was a tough little rat and
you know what I would do with him is that he would
be doing something and I would interfere and he would get upset and you know
angry and so then I would get him to sit on the steps and I told him this was when he was about two
I said look you are going to sit on the steps that's time out you're going to sit of the steps
until you've got control of yourself and you can come back and be
and play the family game again
I basically said be a civilized human being and they you are welcome again
and so he would sit on the steps it was so interesting to watch because
he was just enraged he would sit there
like have you every seen a two year old have a temper tantrum?
It's really quite the bloody phenomena
if you ever saw an adult do that you would like you would call 911
right away it's like oh my God! and I have seen adults do that you know because
people say with borderline personality disorder will have temper tantrums and it's like
man you want to about 30 feet away from that person that's for sure it's really but
in kids it's like
well first of all they are only this long so how much trouble can they really cause
but it's like you know they're just completely gone they are like
on the floor their face is red they are just furious like way more furious than you ever get
if you are even vaguely socialized they are just outraged and they are kicking and hitting the ground and like it's like a little
epileptic fit of anger you know  they are completely controlled by their rage and
we took care of one kid for a while who was actually a pushover that kid you could get him to behave by
you know kind of shaking your finger at him but his mother thought he was really tough
because he had her fooled he had her figured out
and one of the things he would do is have temper tantrums and during the temper tantrum
he would hold his bloody breath until he turned blue!
it's like try that like you know as that's your homework
go home and go home and have a temper tantrum and while you are doing it hold your breath
until you actually turn blue
it's like you won't be able to do it
you don't have the willpower of a two year old
that's for sure that little varmint man he would just have a fit
then he would hold his breath and then he would turn blue it was like Wow! that's that's amazing
and we would just let him do it and you know
he would turn blue and everybody would be gone and he would come out if it you know and
it didn't work so he just quit doing it I think he did it like twice and then he figured out oh well
that's a lot of work for very little outcome and you know it's not like two year old's are stupid they're
they're not stupid but they are probably smarter you
but they are not civilized by any stretch of the imagination and so anyways back to my son
I would put him on the steps and he'd be like RRRRRR! just like enraged!
and and trying to get himself together you know
and I'd wait a few like I had a strict rule which was
as soon as you are done
you're welcome again
so it's completely under your control you
you can get yourself calmed down you come and talk to me again
if you are calm enough so I like you then you are welcome back in the family no grudge nothing
and so it's harder that you think like people think that they like their kids like don't be thinking that
they are hard to like they are little monsters and they are very very pushy and provocative
and so lots of their parents do not like their children
and they do terrible things to them their whole life
so it's no joke and uh
it's very common and you know that was Freud's observation fundamental observation that
a lot of psychopathology is rooted in the family and you can be sure of that
you know and when you hear about some mother who's done something terrible to her child which happens reasonably frequently
you know perfectly well that
she has very terrible capacity to discipline the child has just provoked her
and provoked her and provoked her and provoked her and provoked her
it just happens to be a day where
her new boyfriend left and she is quite hungover and she got fired and it's like
that's the wrong day to provoke her
and then she does something that is not good!
And you read about it and you think Well how could that happen? How could anyone do that? Well
that's how they do it
and so kids they are very provocative just like little chimps
chimps will
the adolescents will like throw little pebbles and sticks at the sleeping larger males
and bug them
and that teasing which it is that teasing
turns into full fledged dominance challenge behaviour once the adolescent males get big enough to do it
and so when you are being provoked by a child which
they provoke you all the time they are trying to figure out well just
Where are you exactly what happens if I do this? What happens if I do this? You know and
how else are they going to figure it out?
Anyways he would sit on the steps and just
he is just enraged and trying to control himself and I would watch that and then you know I'd
come back after about two minutes or whatever and he would still be RRRRRRR!
and I would say well you know have you got yourself under control
are you ready to get of the steps? And he would go NOOOO! NOT YET!
and then you know he would get himself under control
and then he would come back and you know he'd be contrite
and then I would like him right away you know
you got to watch that you know because you don't like being dominated by a two year old no one does
and so if the child hasn't
mastered himself and started to act in accordance with the prevailing social norms
you won't like them well you think Yeah I will because I am a good person. It's like no you won't
and no you are not a good person so don't be thinking about that at all it's just not true
so
when he was contrite then he'd come and then you know we would just go on like nothing had happened
because that is what you want to do right as soon as you get compliance
especially if the compliance is in the best interests of the child
you want to reward it instantly right that's the right thing to do
because so then
and
you could just see him gaining control over himself and so what was really was happening is
His in his mind in his brain we'll say there was a war between the psyche the ego that was starting
to become integrated you know and starting to become a continuous person an identity
and it is fragile in two year old's and it can be disrupted all the time and it is that's why they are so
hyper-emotional it's fragile that little ego
and it doesn't have a lot of power
and so what you want to do is reward it when it wins!
You know when it he gets control over the underlying motivations you want to say
Hey good work man! Good work kid!
You did it you know you got yourself under control way to be! And the kid is really happy about that because
it's actually not that much fun to have a temper tantrum
It's exhausting you know it takes you over
Question?
[Student] Could you give an example of what you would reward him with?
[JBP] Oh just a pat on the head or you know That's good! kind words you know or whatever
[Student] Notice it.
[JBP] Yeah notice it pay attention that's it that's it pay attention and that's a great
it's a great thing to know with people like in your relationships
here is the key to a good relationship it's not the only one but
Watch your person
carefully carefully carefully and whenever they do something that you would like them to do more of
tell them that that was really good and mean it and it's not manipulative because if it's manipulative it won't work
It's like you have to say Wow! I am so glad you did that! And you have to be precise
Here is what you just did that I though was great!
and then Oh boy that's so nice that you noticed I can't believe that noticed It's like
you know you do that twenty times and the person will be
like the rat that's just pushing the lever for cocaine you know
so but no I'm serious Skinner established this B.F. Skinner noticed this a long time ago
Reward is intensely useful in terms of modifying behaviour but the problem is is that
it's really hard to notice when things are going right.
Right because you are kind of primed to notice when things are going wrong and so you use
threat and punishment more often as
agents of shaping the people that you are around because you know when everything is going right
what are you going to say everything is going right
it turns to zero you just assume it
and that's that's not good
that's not good you want to pay attention and if your person your children your wife
whoever your mother
your sister
if you want them to
if you want to rectify your relationships with them and I am not saying to do this in a manipulative way it won't work
but if they do something that's promoting harmony and peace and goodwill it's like
attend to it tell them that you noticed it's like
so useful and you have to get rid of grudges and your resentment to do that
right because you don't want to you are kind of mad at your sister
and then you know she does something good you think there is no goddamn way I am going to reward her for that
so you ignore her when she does something good it's like
that's brilliant that is because then you just punished her for doing what you want
and people do that with their kids all the time
you know because they let the kids dominate them then they get resentful
then the kid will run up to them to show them something that's kind of spectacular and they'll
they are not happy they'll like Oh yeah that's I'm working.
You know little kids
all sad about that and he has just learned something
so and it's not perhaps what you want him to learn
and so you have to keep your relationship with your children pristine
and that means that you can't
hold a grudge or resent them and that means that you have to help them learn how to behave
so that you like them
and that way if you like them
and you are kind of sensible and maybe your partner also likes them so you know you have got a consensus going there
there is a reasonable possibility that other people will actually like them too
including other children and then the world open up to them
you know then you'll bring them to peoples houses and the people will actually smile at them
and give them a pat on the head instead of thinking Oh my God that brats coming to visit again
I wonder what he will break this time.
You know and that's just a horrible thing for your child to experience repetitively in situation after situation
all they learn is that adults have a false smile but they are really lying all the time
God!
It's like a bit of hell and there's a lot of children who are trapped in that it's really awful to see
I can see kids like that when I walk down the street you know it's like they are little doomed things 
and they are you know they are screwed in 15 different ways and there is no way out of it
It's really awful
so
I would not recommend that you do that
It's better to notice that you are a bit of a monster
or a lot of a monster
and notice that
you are much happier with the people around you when they behave in accordance with
reasonable social norms and then you actually feel genuinely connected to them
you want to work on their behalf so that everything works out
but if you think that you are a good person and that you would never do anything that was
harmful to your children then you can just forget about that because you will never take it seriously enough to actually learn
alright so anyways we live inside this story as far as I can tell
you know we kind of put the story together inside us to begin with
and that happens between 2 and 4 when you are
integrating those motivations and emotions into a relatively functional unity
right and that does happen between 2 and 4
if you don't have your kids socialized by the time they are 4 you might as well just forget it
and I know that sounds terribly pessimistic and all of that but I know the literature on
trying to rectify antisocial behaviour in children and after the age of 4 it's virtually impossible no matter what you do.
and the reason for that is that
kids who are still acting like two year old's when they are four
you know they are twice as old eh as a two year old
that's a lot of difference like a four year old is an adult as far as a two year old is concerned
and so if the four year old is still acting like a two year old that's really not good!
and other four year old's will come up and you know
do a little play invitation like a dog and you know the kid the two year old four year old has no idea how to react to that and so the more mature kid thinks
Oh well..
how about I play with you? [motions to another student]
and then that kid is isolated
from the peers and after four you mostly socialized by your peers
and so you just fall farther and farther and farther behind
you are more and more alienated you are more bitter and angry and no wonder
and it's just not you can't rectify it
so
so
so that's useful to know it's like your job from two to four
is to turn your child help turn your child into a functional unity and by three they should be
functional enough as a unity
within themselves so that they can concentrate on a voluntary goal
for some reasonable length of time
which is also why it's useful to let them spend some time alone so that they can learn to amuse themselves
because if they can't amuse themselves they are not going to play with other kids
and then by three
they are sorted together enough so if another three year old comes along
they can at least play in parallel
and may also start maybe able to start playing
a cooperative game
and so that's often a fantasy game you know pretend
and so what the kids will do sometimes they mediate it verbally
but sometimes it's more acted out
it's a combination of the two
they will assign each other roles
they will do this with you too well let's have a tea party
well what does that mean?
well it means let's sit down and act out the act of sharing food
and see if we can get that right
that's what the kids saying we will have a little tea party
you know it's very important because human beings share food like this is a major thing to get right man.
And so the kid will say well you be the Mom and I will be the Dad and you know
we will make little fort and that will be our house and we will go in there and run our roles and
you know we are acting out
we are acting out family
and if we are both reasonably civilized as three year old's we can concentrate on that goal
we can establish that little fictional world
we can
negotiate a mutual goal
and then we can run the simulation and that is what kids are doing when they are pretending
it's bloody brilliant that's play man it's like
It's brilliant!
It's absolutely unbelievable because you know if you are going to play Mom let's say
It isn't like you
it isn't exactly like you imitate your Mom because imitation would be
you know how annoying it is when someone copies you
so you know
you are sitting like that and then and I do the same thing that's really annoying and that isn't what kids do
they don't
act out the precise actions that they have seen the target of their fantasy
display they're way more sophisticated than that they watch
they're mother let's say like hawks
and then they start to extract out the regularities in their behaviour which is Mom behaviour let's say
that's what makes you Mom
whatever that is and then
so it's like they look at you across time and they extract out the regularity that makes you Mother
and then they try to embody that regularity in their pretend play and then they sort of encapsulate or
incorporate the spirit of being a mother or being a father or whatever
or an animal because they'll play at that
and so that is what they are doing they are using their body as and their mind as dramatic forums
it's really amazing you know it's so sophisticated
and no other animal does that as far as we know
and it's the platform on which language is based first of all we imitate
and language is imitation right because we use the same words right so it's imitation
it's a big deal so you can act out someone else
and then you can conceptualize them in fantasy and it is only way after that that you
could maybe articulate it what does it mean to be a mother
so I could have you write an essay about that
well you would have to think about it right?
you wouldn't just automatically know but if someone hands you a baby you know you are not completely
socially blind you roughly know what to do after you are done with your initial nervousness
you roughly know what to do
don't drop it that's a good rule you have probably figured that one out at least
you know don't yell at it don't startle it give it a little pat maybe try hugging it
maybe you go like this you know you make eyes at it you know what to do!
It's built into you you know it's built into you but
that doesn't mean you could lay it out as a series of rules about how to be a mother
it's like you could right a whole damn book about that so
alright so anyways you live in this story
and first of all you get your own story together
and that's by integrating your motivations and emotions together
under social influence
you know
Piaget kind of states that
before the age of three kids can't really play
they are egocentric and it's not exactly right because
you are actually playing with you mother
from the time you are born so even with breast feeding that's a social interaction and
it's a complex cooperative endeavour and it's often hard for a mother and the infant
to get that right
because it's complicated and it requires a lot of social interaction like the child has to learn not to bite for example
you know and a mother has to learn not to be too nervous and
and there is a lot of social bonding it's a really complicated social interaction
so the child the infant even at the earliest stages is already engaged in a complex social dynamic that is essentially play oriented
but it's you know pretty primordial  it has to do mostly with the mouth and
a child's mouth and tongue are already hardwired at birth  so
you child is most this is a Freudian observation as well your child is almost all
mouth and tongue when it's born the rest of it's body well you watch infants  it's like
even when they are
How old?
Seven months? Six months? Four months? I can't even remember now you know they will move their arm and they kind of go like this
it's like they have no fine control they're
it's more like they have
you know clubs on the ends of sticks it's like that
their nervous system isn't
thoroughly myleinated then don't have control over themseleves
but their mouth and tongue are already wired up
and so otherwise they wouldn't be able to swallow or nurse so
the oral element is extraordinarily important for a young child
that's why kids put everything in their mouth
you know even when they are a bit older it's like they see with their tongue
which of course everyone can do
you know if you put a block in your mouth you can tell that it's a cube you can tell that it is a cube without looking
so you can with your tongue you can see with your hands you can even see to some degree with your ears
anyways
so they're a social interaction right from the beginning but for the point of simplification
you might say well first the child
organizes
themselves into a functional unity under the
pressure of social dynamics
and then they get unified enough so that they can attain unity with another child by
setting up a fictional world
and cooperating and competing within that because that's quite interesting to because
you know people often
juxtapose cooperation and competition as if they are opposites
but they are not opposites at all
another Piagetian observation
so you say Well is hockey a competitive game?
and people would say Well yeah! but then you think really!
Really! No one brings a basketball
Right?
So we are going to play by the rules
That's cooperation well are teams competing against each other
Well yes! But they agreed to compete within a particular landscape
and they all cooperate to maintain that landscape and so
you do the same thing when you are playing Monopoly
It's like you are trying to win but at the same time you are cooperating
That's what that's society man! That's society right there!
You are cooperating
That's the big enclosure and within that there are regulated competitions
But to separate those artificially and say one is competition and the other is cooperation is just
It's just not. just not very smart it's not observant that's not how it workd
and games are intensely cooperative even if they are intensely competitive I mean
the  hockey teams are playing in the same game that's the cooperation then each team
there is competition within the team to be the best player let's say but everyone wants that
because everyone wants good players to emerge but still cooperate like mad with your team mates and if you don't pass
and you know play like a reasonable person then they're going to not be happy with you
and so
even within that competition cooperation is regulating the interactions and then you can think
this is a really good thing to think too it's like
People often say to their kids
doesn't matter whether you win or lose it's how you play the game.
and the kid of course has no idea what that means it's like what do you mean I am trying to win
and the parents says No no it matters how you play
and the kid pushes them and the parents really can't come up with a good explanation of why that is the case
They might say Well other kids won't play with you
There you go!
Because you could say
this is something to think about so
there is a game
and there is a victory within the game
but then there is the set of all games
and there is victory across the set of all games
and the victory that you attain across the set of all games
isn't winning all the games
it's being invited to play all the games
and so if you play fair then you are playing a meta-game
and the meta-game is how to win across the set of all games
and so if you teach your child how to behave properly then they always get invited to play
and that makes them winners
and that's that!
and so if you understand that  you understand something
phenomenally important about the emergence of morality
you know because people moral relativist in particular think that morality is relative
and of course human beings are diverse just like languages are diverse
and there is more than one playable game but there is not really more than one playable meta-game
it's like you are either the kind of person that other people want to play with or you are not.
and it you are not the kind of person that people want to play with then you are a loser
it's as simple as that and that's true of all cultures they might be playing different individual games
within their culture and undoubtedly they are but
the set of all games that they play is still common across cultures that's part of what makes us human
and then you could say as well
we are actually evolved to detect people who are good at playing the set of all possible games
and we actually know that that's not theoretical we know for example
some things are easy to remember and some things are to remember you know
Here is something that is easy to remember you play with someone and they cheat
Man you will remember that that's like in your mind that's not going anywhere
and so great are detecting cheaters and you remember
and that's because you can't trust a cheater and you shouldn't invite a cheater to play a game with you because they might cheat!
and so that's part of the innate morality system you remember cheaters because they good at playing the meta-game
and of course you're evolved
of course you are adapted to the meta-game because
you are the product of this immense evolutionary history right and
whoever your ancestors were
which is an unbroken string of successful reproducers going back 3.5 billion years
you think about that every single one of your ancestors
successfully reproduced it's mind boggling that you chances against that
are so it's billions to one and here you are the line of
3.5 billion years of success the whole world was trying to kill you that whole time and here you are it's like and but
you know you are still only going to last about 80 years
but that you know is still you know good for you so anyways
there were lots of games that your ancestors were playing across that immense span of time
many many you know lizard games and tree dweller games
and crustacean games you know the huge set of games
and you are adapted to win across those games all of them
and that's built into you man that's your central human nature that's what makes you social
and it's not some mere cultural construct
quite the contrary it's so deeply embedded in you it's what you are
Alright so well
this is a story it's a game too that's another way of thinking about it you know that's a Monopoly game well
what's the frame
well that's the rules of the game
and are they why do you accept them
Well it's kind of arbitrary right it's like
that happens to be the rules hockey has different rules
basketball has different rules but what they share is that they have rules
OK so there is a frame that's the rules and then within the frame there is a goal
and the goal is whatever the rules dictate you know there is usually
It's usually the construction of a heirarchy
of success within a frame
and so that's what you play and so you play Monopoly and it's like we'll accept the rules
that's the social contract and then we will each try to win
and that will be fun!
We find that amusing and if you lose what do you say?
Well you say there is always another game
and so that's great so
if you have that attitude and you play fair then it doesn't matter whether you win or lose
although you still want to try to win because otherwise you are not a good player
but you accept defeat gracefully because
you can play again!
and so and you will win some and you will lose some and that's not so bad you know and
even if you lose well maybe you learned something  and
and you're doing a lot more than one thing while you are playing Monopoly you know you are having a conversation and
learning how to interact with people and learning how to regulate your emotions and so
even if you lose if you have any sense you win
and if your kids have any sense they know that
and so that way you buffer then against defeat it's like yeah yeah you know
next time
it's OK
You should try but it is OK
and and that's useful information for people to know
alright so you are always in one of these little frameworks and there is just no getting out of it so
and that's because you know at any given moment
this is like field theory there used to be psychological theories that talked about the field of human experiance
something like that and this is kind of what that is this is a field and
basically what happens is that you parse out a little part of the world
an amount that you can handle
so let's say it has some duration  you are not aiming at something 50 years in the future
it's because how the hell are you going to to that?
there are too many variables you know so your aiming at some handleable amount of time
and you posit a goal in there and you plot your route and then
that tells you what is up and tells you what is down because up moves you towards the goal and down moves you away from the goal and
that's sets up your motivation framework so that
you have something worth attaining you know that's a really interesting thing to know too it's like
Why have a goal?
Well it's easy no goal no positive emotion.
Because you experience positive emotion by noticing that you are moving towards a goal
and so if you don't have a goal
well you can't have any positive emotion! So you better have a goal and so you might say well what should the goal be?
Well we could start by saying well any goal is better than none.
And then we might say well it should be a goal that other people
will let you pursue because otherwise it's going to be kind of difficult
and maybe they will be even happy to help you pursue it that would even be better
and maybe it's a goal that would enable you to learn how to pursue other goals
while you pursue that goal boy that would really be good
And so you can see that your goal was parameterized
but that doesn't mean that any old goal works it means there's some goals that work nicely
and some not so nicely there are playable games and non-playable games that's a good way of thinking about it
and you want to have a playable game and there is a lot of them
lawyer plumber you know
actor whatever they are playable games
and it's not obvious which one is better but
it's certainly obvious which ones are sustainable and which ones are worse
and so they're is a set of playable games and you need to extract from that set of playable games
a game that suits you.
and that would be partly due to your temperament you know because extroverted people want to play an extroverted game
highly neurotic people want to play a safe game
agreeable people want to play generous game and
disagreeable people want to play a game that highly competitive so they can win and
you know fine!
but they're all within the realm of playable games
and that means they are socially acceptable as well
and so that means it isn't just
arbitrary it isn't just relative
what you decide to do it is heavily parameterized there is only
there is a set of playable games and it's large the set is large but
there are commonalities within it and that's why there are commonalties
that is why morality has a common basis
fundamentally and so that's partly what we are trying to investigate it's like
what's up what is up mean?
what does it mean is there such a thing now
one thing to remember is that
if you don't erect a hierarchical structure with something to aim at
you got no positive motivation
because you experience positive motivation in relationship to a goal not from attaining the goal
that's satisfaction besides it's fleeting
you know perfectly well you graduate from university poof! Next day you have a problem
which is what do you do next and that's a tough problem
it's not like you solved your problems by winning that game
you just introduced the problem of having to introduce another game!
so it's unreliable as a source of positive emotion but what's reliable is you set a goal.
and you try to attain it
and then that gives your life literally
provides your life with meaning
that's what meaning is now it's more than that but that's what it is
and so then you might ask yourself well
What's a really good goal?
Well that's what we are trying to figure out what's a really good goal? And now
OK so you got that so now I am going to walk through at least partly through
we will see how far we get I am going to walk through Pinocchio with you because that is what the movie is about and
it's a
it's hard to say how it come about like it was written the story by a guy named
Collodi [spells it]
it's quite a bit different the story that story the written one from the Disney version
the Disney version was a product of the collaboration of
geniuses of animation essentially so they were artistic geniuses
great at capturing motion and emotion and all of that
they were stellar at that
and imaginative tremendously imaginative but collectively imaginative
and so they put together a collective product
and you might say well how did they do that exactly it's like well
they were good storytellers and what does that mean well
it means you know the story that works and the story that doesn't
and maybe partly what you do is you kind of think out a story and you think well what is this happened?
Well maybe this should happen?  Oh! That's the thing! That would work!
It's like a little flash of inspiration right it's like
you got a piece of the puzzle that fits you think That will work there!
and then you talk to the other people and you generate ideas and someone says What if?
What if they do this? And then everyone goes No no that's just not believable no ones going to buy that.
and someone else has a little revelation they say Well you know it makes some sense somehow if
if they do this! And then everybody goes Oh yeah! That really
that really works!
It's like why?
Why? why?
Well you don't know you don't know why it works
but it works because
It works because it's the right story
and so what does that mean?
well it's kind of associated with this meta-game idea
you know there is a story that you should be acting out that works across games
and you have an inkling of it you have notion of it you have a vague apprehension of it
it's sort of built into you that's an archetype that's an archetype
and so when you read a story that works you are just entranced by it and you all know that
You go to a movie and it's a great movie and you are just blown away you know it's
a movie can pull you in
and turn you into one of the screen characters and like run you through a huge set of emotions.
I saw this movie once about
South America it started with this guy running out of a subway naked and he didn't know where he was
and it turned out that he had been
absconded by the totalitarian death squads and he couldn't remember anything about himself and
he went back to his village and basically what happened was that he ended up back in the totalitarian death grip.
and it showed how the fascist state had saturated the village completely and
so it was a tragedy and you could see with every action that
this amnestic guy as he recreated himself and remembered his identity
was going to travel down exactly the same road because nothing had changed
and by the time I wish I have looked what that movie was for years I've never been able to find it again
but when the movie was over every single person in the theater was crying
and not just a little bit they were just out of it it was brilliant
terrifying movie
and that meant that was something right about it man
and it got people and you you might say
you know you have dim apprehensions about the world
and some of those are instinctual and some of those are a consequence of your
of your experience and it's like
the pieces are fragmented but if you get away from them a long ways you can see how they fit together
but they are fragmented and then you go see a story and those pieces go
click click click click
and then you think Wow! That's what that's how that works out that's what that means
and that produces that overwhelming emotion and then and that partly how you make yourself
transparent to yourself
You go and experience a story and watch a story and you tell a story and you start to find out who you are by doing that
My nephew had a dream at one point
someone made a little animated thing out of it and put it on the Internet which is quite cool
So anyways he was having night terrors and he ran around like a little knight
you know k-n-i-g-h-t knight and he had a little
you know armor and a sword and he would run around the house
with a little knight hat on being a knight
and he was only like four or something and he had watched a lot of Disney movies
a lot of movies so he kind of got the knight idea it was
He was acting that out and he was having terrors at night right
and so he would go to bed with his little knight hat and his sword and he would put them on his bed and then
at night he would wake up screaming and that happened for a very long time and so
when I went to visit you know I found out that this was happening and
he had night terror so the kid wakes up with night terrors
screaming but can't remember anything generally speaking so
anyways this was happening and so
it happened one day and I was sitting with him and his family at the breakfast table and I said Did you have a dream? and he said Oh yes I had a dream
I said Well what was your dream?
and he said
Well I was out in this field I was surrounded by the dwarves and they came up to my knees and
they were they didn't have any arms they had big feet
and they were covered with hair and there was a cross shaved at the top of their head and they were all greasy and they had huge beaks
and every where I went they jumped at me with their beaks
and there was lots of them!
and every body was very quiet after he said this because it was like
Oh that's why you were screaming at night it's like yeah OK!
and so
so then he said
But at the background there was a dragon and the dragon would
blow out smoke and fire and then it would turn into these dwarves!
so it's like man that kid had a problem right it was like
Well what are you going to do fight off a dwarf who cares! Puff!
Ten more that's life man that's life!
Really!
That's the Hydra
you cut off one head and seven more grow that's life snakes everywhere
and you get rid of one and there will be more
and so he figured that out!
It's a hell of an existential shock when you are four
and so he is like he is a knight he's thinking what do I do about these dwarves
well their are too many of them but there is a dragon
well so I said Well what could you do about that?
Right loaded question it implies that you could do something about that!
Well he kind of knew that which he was running around like a knight
and he kind of figured that out
and he said Well I'll get my dad
and I jump up on the dragon and I poke out both of his eyes with my sword and then I go right down its stomach
to the place where the fire came out the firebox and then I'd carve a piece of the firebox out and make a shield
and that would be the end of that! And I thought
Wow! Good work kid! Like
you really got it right it's the central human story.
There's the terrible unknown right fire breathing
generating trouble
and what do you do you confront that you confront that
and by confronting it you get stronger that's the shield and that's
that's what a human being is
and that's right it's exactly right
and that was the end of his night terrors by the way
which seems to good to be true but it is actually true
because I followed up with his mother for a long time and that was that!
He catalyzed that part of his identity
he adopted the role of the mythological hero
and that's what he needed to do because like there was a dragon and a bunch of dwarves
like what the hell are you going to do about that? Run? That's not going to help.
You know if you run in a dream like that
the dwarves multiply and the get bigger and you get smaller as you run
It's like that no a good that is not a good solution
and people do that in their life all the time and so the dwarves get bigger until they are giants
and they get smaller until there is nothing left of them and then
then there is no recovery that is not good
Now OK so now I also proposed to you that there is a symbolic structure to the world
It's a meta-structure I would say I think these categories are truly real
and their basically this! There's
unexplored territory and explored territory
and there is you!
and unexplored territory is the source of great riches and probably will kill you and
explored territory is you culture and it crunches you into submission and conformity
and turns you into a civilized being and
you are stuck with both of those and then there is you you know you are kind of admirable and cool and you do a lot of
decent wonderful amazing things and there are things about you that are just horrible
and you know about them and you are stuck with them and that's the world
and that's the the landscape of the world and what you will see
if you pay attention is that people who are ideologues like Rousseau or say like Hobbes
but it doesn't matter ideologues will tell you part of that story
so environmentalists for example will say
Nature that's pristine beauty
natural harmony
French landscape
it's a paradise especially if there are no people it's a paradise
and then culture is a rapacious monster
and human beings driving that culture against nature are
monsters of a sort that and perhaps there should be fewer of then it's like yeah yeah that's all true
it's exactly dead on right on exactly right
Was that movie called Avatar?
Yes that's James Cameron's movie right?
That's that story yeah and
Hey it's a good story
It's even a mythological story but it is only half the story
The other story you could think about it as a frontier myth that's Star Trek
or Star Wars for that matter mostly Star Trek it's like
but we will put it into the context of the frontier myth the myth that drew settlers into America say. It's well
there is a wild savage landscape out there that can be conquered by and settled and stabilized by civilization
and it will be the heroic pioneer who does it
It's exactly the opposite story of the environmental story which is why I think that the environmental story emerged. It was
you know the frontier story
had a lack in it it missed half of the world
and so the other story had to come up and it did
and if you take both of those  stories even though they are exactly the opposite to one another
if you know both those stories then you know the whole story
and it's really weird you know because one of the propositions of formal logic
is it's a fundamental proposition is that something can't be itself and it's opposite at the same time it's like
that's true for some sorts of things it's true for logical claims
but it is completely wrong in this particular situation because things are what they are and their opposites at the same time
and that makes it very very difficult to
that's why a dragon hoards gold it's like
What's up with that?
Well it will eat you!
And it will but it has gold!
So what do you do about that? Because it's paradoxical demands
well what you want to do is face the dragon and get the damn gold that's what you want to do
well
you have to be a paradoxical being even to do that so in The Hobbit
for example when what's his name
Frodo right? It's not it's Bilbo in The Hobbit
You know he is kind of this little underdeveloped
over protected Shire dweller and
he is called on a great adventure
to go and find the dragon and he has to become a thief
in order to manage it
Well that's pretty weird you know it's like it's because
as a good citizen he is just not enough to conquer a dragon
He also has to become a bad citizen in some sense he has to incorporate the part of himself that is monstrous
let's say and develop that and hone it
and that's to say that if you are harmless you are not virtuous
you are just harmless
you are like a rabbit
a rabbit isn't virtuous it's just can't do anything except get eaten
it's not virtuous
If you are a monster and you don't act monstrously then you are virtuous but you also have to be a monster
Well you see this all the time Harry Potter is like that too it's like he is flawed
he's hurt he has go evil in him he can talk to snakes man
He breaks rules all the time
All the time he is not obedient at all but you know he has a good reason for breaking the rules
and if he couldn't break the rules
him and his little clique of rule breaking troublemakers if they didn't break the rules
they wouldn't attain the highest goal
so it is very peculiar but it's very it's a very very very very common mythological notion
You know the hero has to be a monster
the hero has to be a monster
but a controlled monster Batman is like that you know I mean it's everywhere it's the story you always hear
you know you are kind of implicitly moral in so far as you are socialized
but that is sort of procedural it's just built into you
this is different this is also becoming conscious of it
and expanding out your personality into dimensions that it wouldn't normally occupy so
this happens to people all the time
So for example lots of my clients my clinical clients are too agreeable
and they are generally women because women are more agreeable than men
but not always because I have had agreeable men as clients as well
and what happens is they're resentful and they don't how to stand up for themselves and it's because they're
very compassionate by nature and so if you entering into a negotiation with them they will let you win
Well that's not so good because you need to win to
Especially if you are in an organisation of adults
where there is a struggle right
When you have kids you can let them win
especially infants like you have to let them win and that's partly
why compassion is so necessary but as a
basis for negotiation between adults it's like
Sorry it's insufficient you have to be a bit of a monster so that you can say no.
And so a lot of what you do in psychotherapy
is treat peoples anxiety and depression that's a huge chunk of it
help them straighten out the way they think that's a huge chunk of it but another chuck of it is
well let's toughen you up you know let's put you in a position where you can bargain let's teach you how to
assert yourself and stand up for yourself and that's assertiveness training and it's a huge chunk of psychotherapy
and you need to learn it because
part of how you regulate your interactions with other people is to negotiate
and you cannot negotiate unless you can say no
you can't do it
and it cause conflict to say no and if you don't like conflict
which is basically the definition of being agreeable
then you cannot tolerate the conflict and so then you can't negotiate on your own behalf
and so then you keep losing!
And you are bullied and you know
it's not good then you get resentful and
and it's really not good so you have to
develop your inner monster a little bit
and and then that makes you a better person not a worse person
It's weird!
It's weird but
but that's just how it is.
Outside of that
diagram is chaos itself and that's the chaos from which things emerge now
I can't tell you much about that yet because it's do damn complicated
but I think the best way to think about chaos is as potential
That's one way of thinking about it.  It's also that place you end up when you don't know what to do.
It's the source of all things but it is also the terrible predator the terrible eternal predator that lurks beyond the explored domain.
It's a winged dragon
and it's winged who knows why matter and spirit that's partly what it is
and I will explain that later
It's also potentially the predatory beast that's been after us for forever
And the winged predator that picked us off from the sky so
primates for example monkeys have
some monkeys have three specialized alarm crys one is for snakes and that usually means
Hit the trees! And then one is for leopards and that means hit the trees and go out on a skinny branch
because the leopard can't get to you
and then there is one for like birds of pray which means hide somewhere on the ground so that you don't get picked off and it's like well
That's what that is that's what that is
and that's chaos
and it's expanded into much more than that
and then I showed you I don't remember if I showed you this but this is a symbolic representation of
Mother Nature Father Culture and the suffering of the individual but it is all that's all positive
There's no negative elements there
but that's OK
that's a partial representation and those things are sacred in some sense because
they are representative of an ultimate
reality of an ultimate reality the sacrificial individual here the suffering individual well that's pretty straight forward it's like
that's what that's life
that's suffering that's life
that's what happens to the individual so and everyone is looking at that.
It has power that idea
Well it's because you know
culture supports the suffering individual and culture is nested inside benevolent nature and that's
part of the story of the world
and it's the part of the story we are trying to figure out and make articulate we have been doing that
for thousands of years trying to make this story articulate
and it's not yet articulated it's only we are only getting it we are getting it
and we basically do that now with movies and stories and fiction and that sort of thing
We still don't have it articulated
I think Jung went close came closer than anyone else
Jung and Erich Neumann who was one of his students
came closer than anyone else ever has to actually articulating that and that's what Jung was trying to do
Is to take all these images archetypal images
Instinctual images and say well what do they mean? What do they mean? What do they mean?
And he got a long ways on that although his writing is quite obscure and it's obscure because
How the hell are you going to explain an image like that without being obscure? It's like
it's insanely complicated and it's not linear
It's not a linear thing that's why it's in a picture
Because a picture presents everything at once
and you want to take that apart linearly. Jesus! It's just it's just impossible.
But we have been struggling to do that really we have been struggling
From the time that we became self-conscious
You know what is the world about? How should we live in it?
Well that's a partial answer and it's a culture bound answer obviously
But you see archetypal representations like this in many cultures so for example
the image of the Virgin and Child that way predates Christianity
like the Egyptians that was Isis and Horus that goes back hoh we have no idea how far
thousands and thousands of years before the emergence of Judaism and Christianity
Way back before that and no doubt
back into prehistory itself! Because
a culture that doesn't hold
the mother and child as sacred dies!
Obviously!
Because obviously!
So it has to be held it has to be held as something
that you revere which at least means that you don't kill mothers and children it at least means that!
And that's an instinct you know it's an instinct it violates you to to that and thank God!
Alright
Let's take 15 minutes
So
I told you about this a little bit last week but you know one of the motivations I had for thinking about the things that I have thought through
the motivation I had for thinking them through was because
Well I
It seemed self-evident to me let's say
and I think that it was partly from reading Jung but that just helped me clarify it was that
You know it was sort of Jung's contention that
We had an organic development of a metaphysical ethic
that was embedded in in religious tradition
and that basically unfolded let's say in the West until about 1600 1500 something like that and then
science emerged and we got unbelievably technologically powerful
using a certain view of the world
you know we are so technologically powerful
but we are still not very wise
and that just seem to me to be a bad combination
and I thought about that a lot it's like OK how do you handle the combination of
exceptional technological power and
and an impaired ethic let's say
something like that underdeveloped ethic or one in even which you have no faith because
you know it seems the foundational elements of it are irrational they're in mythology
they're in religion they don't fit well with the scientific world view
How do you rectify that problem? And
Well that's a tough problem you know it's a crazy problem
and certainly it was the problem that Jung was trying to address there is no doubt about it
Along with that went an associated problem which was you know what happened in the 20th century
which was so awful
and in so many places it was just so unbelievably brutal and terrible and it was perpetrated by
millions of people and they were individual people and they weren't that much different from normal people
and in fact they were normal people. So
the other thing that struck me was that it would be better if that sort of thing didn't happen anymore
and so I was trying to figure what the hell could possibly be done about that and
you know part of Jung's contention was well you had to understand yourself as a monster if you were ever going to
maintain some control over the fact that you are in fact a monster and that that could come forth if the situation is correct
Ok that seems reasonable and so
Well it seemed to me that  you know people had to become wiser
and of course that's a very difficult things to figure out because you could even question
whether there is such a thing as wisdom you know and
and then I thought well that's what the universities are supposed to do especially the humanities mostly in particular
it is supposed to make you wise that's what it's for
and it's a doing a terrible job of that in my estimation
it's more decimating people as far as I can tell and undermining whatever ethic that they have
rather than making people wise
and
but I think that we have to become wise I don't think that there is a choice I think it's a matter of survival and it's more than that because if you're wise in your own life you are going to have a way better life
like incomparably better because you are going to
sleep soundly with a good conscience at night and you know people say that's worth more than money
that's worth more than money. I know lots of people who have lots of money and let me tell you
money protects you you are as well as protected from the world by money right now as you ever will be for the rest of your life
because most of life's fundamental problems can't be solved with money!
you know like rich people get divorced they have affairs their children get sick
they have all the problem you have and that's partly because you are already rich
And so you might think that if you had a bunch more money  things would be better
but it's just not true in fact in some ways they might be worse
because money can open up
can open up the possibility of all sorts of temptations to you that you just can't afford at the moment
So well so economics we have already solved that problem fundamentally
and we are rapidly solving it everywhere in the world right.
The world economy is growing so damn fast that you can't even imagine how you could possibly make it grow any faster
It's crazy we have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the last 15 years you know
The U.N. set a goal by 2015 I think it was to cut poverty by half
if I remember correctly and they reached it two years early you know it's like
It's unbelievable! So
Well so then I started to
try to understand what it might be to
to live and really what I was looking for and was not so much to live a life that was wise
but at least to live a life that wasn't pathologically unwise
you know I thought of
the sorts of things that people were doing to one another in the
Auschwitz camps and in the Gulag Archipelago and all of that
horror that was perpetrated on
on people as definitely unwise whatever else you might say about it
it was unwise so then I though maybe there is a way to figure out how you could not do that!
And so that's
and I think that that's
my sense is that when you come to university to learn how to be a civilized person
which is what is supposed to happen at university
otherwise it is just a trade school and you might as well go to trade school as far as I am concerned if you want
to learn something that will get you a job it's like it's a lot
faster and it's more certain and it's useful
if you are not taught to be a citizen at university then
Why bother with it?
So well so that's what we are trying to figure out!
and and that's part of that
cloud of mythological fantasy that surrounds our culture that's
it's part of its deep history that we are trying to
you know if you grapple with the humanities and with art and all of that
that you are trying you are trying to master and incorporate and
pull in to you so that you're situated properly in history and
and you are not just floating in the void of you know this
tiny individuality that is divorced from everything else you are weak in that circumstance
Alright so
that's more of an explanation of why I try to puzzle through these things and try to puzzle through them with you
So anyways we talked about this song last week and
you know I made a hypothesis to you we'll go through this quickly
It's doggerel it's not great poetry but it is irrelevant
It was a very popular son it's quite beautiful
In the movie it actually sung by like a heavenly choir that's what it sounds like so
Its got this cathedral you can imagine people singing it in a cathedral essentially
and so that's not accidental it's purposeful
you know it partakes of that
what would you call it it partakes of that esthetic that's. that's it
So the film makers are are
implying that
what is about to be shown to you has this
divine element essentially and that that's signified by the choir of voices that sings this song
and the song says fundamentally something like this
is that if you lift up our eyes above the temporal into the transcendent and so that's
what exists in the heavenly world in the stars
if you pick an ultimate goal if you pick the right ultimate goal
then
and anyone can do this that's the other thing it's democratic
it's anyone can do this so that's the second proposition It doesn't matter who you are
You can do this.
And so I think that's a reflection of the idea of the divinity of the individual it's like
there is something about each individual that's valuable regardless of their idiosyncrasies  and
and so they have this potential that they can manifest and how you manifest it? Well
you pick the right goal and what's the right goal well it's high
it's elevated it's above the mundane
Now what does that mean? Well you don't really know you don't really know? That's why it is signified by a star and
the star is something that glimmers in the night right
so it's a source of light in the darkness
And so there is a metaphor in there obviously there is a metaphor there.
And the star is the star that that's the star of Hollywood
you know the person that you emulate that's part of it because an ideal
is it's going to be a human ideal of some sort that you are going to be aiming at
and so the ideal human being is the star that you are aiming at maybe it's something like that.
If that's what you are aiming at well you might say well What should you aim at in life? And one answer is well
Why don't you aim at being
whatever you could be that would be the best!
Now you don't know what that is exactly because how do you know
you know what you could think Well that would be really good if I could have it And then you could say Well
can I think of anything better than that? and if the answer is no then well why not go for that?
You know well you might say Well it's too ambitious it takes too much responsibility.
It's like yeah yeah those are definitely problems and
one of the things that I have figured out over the years is that if you offered the person the opportunity you know
because people say Well life doesn't really have any ultimate meaning. It's like
yeah OK fine let's say that it has an ultimate meaning
but that in order to experience that ultimate meaning you have to take on ultimate responsibility for what you do.
That's a heavy price to pay to have a meaningful life.
You know and you might say Well there's no damn way I going to do that I'll just go for the you know pointless
I'll go for the trivial pointless perspective which is kind of hard on me existentially but it frees me up I can do whatever the hell I want
moment to moment I don't have any ultimate responsibility.
and so then you think That's kind of a good deal. And then but that raises this weird spectre
of doubt which is well when you hear people talk about the ultimate futility of life
is it because life is ultimately futile or is it because they have decided that
they would just as soon not adopt the responsibility and they use that real decision which is to not adopt the responsibility
they rationalize that by proposing that life is ultimately meaningful (sic) meaningless
and like you know I kind of buy that I really do think that's what is going on.
So maybe not
but it could be that if you want to have an ultimately meaningful life that you have to adopt ultimate responsibility
Makes sense and what might that mean?
Well one thing it might mean is that
And I do think it means this is that
I think that it was Alexander Pope but I might be wrong about that who said Nothing human is foreign to me
[transcibers note] Publius Terentius Afer Terence I am a man: nothing human is foreign to me.
and that's a hell of a statement right because if you  think about all the things that human beings are capable of
and they are capable of some
like if you really want to know what people are capable of you should read about Unit 731
but I would not recommend it because if you read it you will never forget it and you will be sorry that you read it
but you'll know
Anyways to say that human is foreign to you that's a hell of a thing to say because
that means that what other people have done you could do
and that also means you need to take responsibility for that
that's no joke you know it's a big deal to do that in even a trivial manner
Anyways so the idea is you can elevate if you elevate you viewpoint to some transcendent
ethic that you want what is ultimately good you really want that whatever that is!
You don't know that's what you are aiming at
Well then it says this strange thing well what you want will all of a sudden come to you
well that's a proposition and it's the proposition that basically played out in the movie.
It's a hypothesis the hypothesis is the best way to orient yourself
in life is to orient yourself towards the highest good that you are capable of imagining
and then aim at that and then things will work the best way they can for you.
And I think I believe that that is correct it's my observation of life
has lead me to see that that seems to be correct
So for example
you don't get something that you don't aim at
that just doesn't work out and so lots of people aim at nothing and that's what they get.
So if you aim at something you have a reasonable crack at getting it you know
you tend to change what you are aiming at along the way because like what do you know you know
You aim there you are wrong but you get a little closer and then you aim there and you are still wrong
you get a little closer and you aim there and you know
As you move towards what you are aiming at  you are characterization of what to aim at becomes more and more sophisticated
And so it doesn't really matter if you are wrong to begin with as long as you are smart enough to learn on the way
and as long as you specify a goal so specify a vague one
I want things to be the best they could be and I am willing to learn what best means as I go along
Ok ok so fine and then you get
what you truly need we'll say well maybe not
Know that if your heart is in your dream
What does that mean?
Well that to me reflects this idea of a kind of integrated viewpoint.
One of the things Jung proposed was that as you
integrate yourself psychologically what happens is that
Your rationality integrates with you emotions
they stop being opposed forces like the Enlightenment ideas that rationality and
and desire are opposites and enemies in a sense
The Jungian notion and the psychoanalytic notion I would say in general
and the humanist notion even perhaps is that no that's not right
what you want to do is you want to integrate your rationality with your emotions and your motivations
They're not separable even technically
they have to work together and that all has to be integrated with you body
not only do you have to take your
heart into account and notice what is is that you want and don't want
but you also have to embody that you have to act that out in the world
So fine that's what that means and if you do that then
Well then your horizons will open up and
I also believe that's true you know I have known people in my life who are insanely successful like
insanely successful
and those people are like they're
They're pretty damn together man you know like they are tough smart
strategic generous you know they are always giving people opportunities honest
like they have got it all
and you know and sometimes now I am not saying that everyone who is wildly successful
Is wildly successful because they have got themselves together but
you know because there are people who are crooks and you know there are people who gain status
one way or another by nefarious means
but that's a lot more unstable than you might think
and I can't say exactly if that if you pursue that route
you are going to pay for it you will have your money or whatever it is but
it's not going to do much good for you so
And so it does seem to me that people that have integrated themselves and that
and that are pursuing a noble goal a high goal who
actually are able to do remarkable things and remarkable things can be done at every level
you know it isn't like you have to change the world
as a whole it could be that you do something remarkable within your family
you know that can be tremendously admirable you know someones got to take care of a family member if they are sick
you know there are heroic acts that you can undertake in the local environment
and maybe that will go unheralded let's say but
that doesn't mean that it isn't remarkable I mean
I have met people who are so damaged
you just can't imagine it and yet
Well one person I met when I was in Montreal
was this women and she was just ruined man
she looked like a street person and she was so shy she couldn't even look at you like
she basically looked at the ground because it was like there was light emanating from everyone else
and she was way too timid and humble to even to bear it.
And you know partly what I was doing was trying to get her to straighten up and not look so street personish
because it wasn't going very well for her in social interactions you know
but it turned out that isn't what she came to the behavioural therapy unit for
and she had her aunt I think she lived with her aunt who was like schizophrenic and then
her aunt's boyfriend was an alcoholic who like went on long harangues about the devil and it's like really man
and she wasn't bright this women she really wasn't and
You know she really didn't have a job and it was just like it was just not good in every way
and then she also had this unbelievable humility and
But then it turned out what she wanted I just couldn't bloody well believe this that
she had this dog and she used to walk it around she took care of the dog and you know that was a good thing and
and she had actually been an inpatient at the Douglas hospital which is where I was working and
they're were inpatients in the Douglas hospital and this was back in the 80's and
those people were like she was like Superwomen compared to the inpatients at the Douglas hospital
those people looked like they were from a Hieronymus Bosch painting
because they had deinstitutionalized everyone that could possibly be deinstitutionalized
and so the only people that were left were people who couldn't be deinstitutionalized
and so those were the people who were in the psyche wards for like 30 years and
all of the hospitals were connected by tunnels underground and the patients used to hang out
down there by the Coke machine and so forth and one day I took my brother down there he was visiting and
like it was just like he just turned white you know because it was just
really I don't know if you know Hieronymus Bosch he is a very interesting painter to say the least but
that's what it was like and so
So here was here idea! She had come to the behavioural therapy unit because she had been
she had been in the inpatient ward for a while and she met some of these ruined people
and she tried to get the hospital she thought
While I am walking my dog you know well maybe I could take one of these patients out for a walk
you know and she had been talking to the hospital administrators trying to get her
allow her to go you know take out one of these patients and go for a walk with her dog.
and basically she had come to the behaviour therapy unit because that's what she wanted to do it's like
Man that person she just blew me away like it's like
I just couldn't believe it like she had nothing going for her
like nothing
and yet she wanted to you know help some people that were worse off and like
there just weren't that many people that were worse off than her
Mind boggling mind boggling!
I never forgot it.
and it really really blew me away
you know there are opportunities for elevating your sights
within your realm of capability wherever you happen to be and
and that's interesting it's strange that that is the case
[reading] She brings those who love that's what that's should say  the sweet fulfillment of their longing
Like a bolt out of the blue Fate characterized here as feminine
and that's what happens in the movie the movie has got a Christian underbelly like
it's quite pronounced but it's really a pagan movie in many ways so for example
there is no blue fairy
and the reason I am speaking of Christianity of course is because this movie was
created in a culture where Christianity was still reasonably intact
and of course it was fully informed by that but
the underlying mythos is not precisely Christian even though it is informed by Christian imagery
There is this old idea I think it's  an Gnostic idea that
the wisdom of God is feminine something like that an anima which means soul is feminine
and so there is an idea like that lurking here
and anyways that's fate and that's the blue fairy in this particular movie you know she comes down from this star which is
kind of makes her a avatar of God that's the idea
and she's the transformative agent she's really Mother Nature
you know in her positive guise and
that's why she can animate
to animate something means to infuse it with soul that's what it means
and she animates Pinocchio right she is the force that frees him from his strings
and so that's her Fate
[reading] Like a bolt out of the blue Fate steps in and sees you through
Well what that means it means something like
It means something like this is that
if you orient properly in the world and we will say that you do that by trying to attain
the ultimate goal whatever that happens to be then it is as if the world is on your side
and things go well for you and I also believe that that is true because certainly one of the things that more or less self evident is that generally speaking if you tell the truth
things go a lot better for you and the reason for that is well heh
you want to be do you want to have reality opposed to you?
Or do you want to have reality backing you up? It's like it's a pretty straight forward question
If you are truthful to the degree that you can be truthful then reality is on your side
That's a good thing because there is a lot of it and there isn't much of you
Whereas if you take a  deceitful approach to things well then you're challenging reality
It's like good luck with that man!
It's like you are holding a plastic ruler in front your face and bending it you know and at some point
you are going to let go and it's going to all that force that you have
stored up and it's going to snap back and nail you  and that happens
Like I have just never seen anyone in my clinical practice ever get away with anything
Nothing!
And it's not surprising it's like if you are going to mess with the structure of reality
Like it's going to mess back and it does and it might not happen for years and you might not even notice the connection
I mean part of what you do in psychotherapy is actually
make those connections it's like why did this horrible thing happen to me
Well
Who knows?
It's like let's take it apart well who knows how far back we have to go
It might even have things to do not even with you it might have things to do with the errors in parents relationship
Like
you just can't mess with the structure of reality it
It stays warped until you straighten it out and
it's not good.
So so there and injunction here which is that you know if you follow this path you
pick a high goal and and you put your heart in it you know you commit to it
believe in it believe means to love believe and belove it's the same thing it's means to act out
and that's what the belief means  like we think that belief means to accept a set of propositions as true
Well that is one form of belief but
that's more like factual knowledge right belief is more like you decide that you are going to act something out
you make a decision and then you act it out and that is a reflection of you belief
You know you are staking yourself on something do you know?
Well no! Because you can't you can't know you are bounded by ignorance you can make your best guess and move forward
and you can do that with commitment but you have to believe in order to do that
I guess that's why it's a wish
Ok so fine
Well then we have Jiminy Cricket Southern U.S. slang for Jesus Christ by the way and the initial overlap isn't
a fluke I mean I am sure that the animators thought that that was funny and of course it is funny and it
you know in the Lion King you know that that baboon
whose the shaman basically well to begin with he was kind of just a comic relief character like a fool you know but
One of the things that Jung mentioned about the fool is that the fool tends to turn into the saviour and it's an archetypal reality
Bugs Bunny is sort of like that you know he is a trickster
and as the movie developed the character of the fool baboon took on the full fledged
you know  shaman priest element and
and you know OK Jiminy Cricket he is this little cricket and
and he turns out to be the conscience which is pretty damn weird it's like a bug is your conscience
and the bug is J.C. and that a very strange juxtaposition of ideas conscience insect
saviour it's like what's up with that
and so well what bugs you that's part of it
Well your conscience certainly bugs you
and you should pay attention to it's it's just niggling little annoying thing that you can't
quite you can override it right obviously
but it's this well he says when he talks to Pinocchio later it's that still small voice you know
and I have asked people before like in my personality class like
because conscience is a weird thing and it
and like  if I said to you
if you are about to do something that you know you shouldn't do.
Do you have a voice in your head that tells you that you shouldn't do it? So how many people have had that experience?
OK OK good now so other people have a feeling instead of a voice and so is there anybody here
who's willing to admit it who has neither the feeling neither the voice?
OK so you know it's a very understudied phenomena in psychology this conscience
I mean people can be conscientious and maybe those are people who listen to their conscience more
I don't know but nobody has ever investigated it and the fact that do this little voice whatever it is inside your head it's like what the hell is up with that?
You know it doesn't tell you what you want to hear.
At least as far as I can tell now you could say Well that's the internal representation of society operating within you.
That would be a Freudian view that's the superego and certainly there is something to that
I don't think that it is necessary to presume that that's all there is to it and even if it is
you still wouldn't have the voice if you didn't have the biological potential
to have that voice embed itself in you.
So even if it is socioculturally constructed which it is in part
It's like language it's like your language is socioculturally constructed but the reason you can speak
is because human beings can speak and if you have a conscience it's because human beings have a conscience
and the contents of that conscience might differ but the fact that it exists
seem to me to be
universal. OK well so that's the conscience
and
that's Jiminy Cricket
and then the cricket opens this book then you look at the book
and you think Well what kind of book is that?
Well it's got a spot light on it
so it's being highlighted this is an important book  and what kind of book is it?
Well it's leather bound it has a lock on it you know it's not some cheap book it's kind of like a
you might think about it  it looks like something from an old library or maybe it looks biblical
Whatever! It's a major league book and this bug is the introduction to the book
So does that mean your conscience is the introduction to the book?
Well?
Maybe that is what it means it's certainly what's being played out in the movie.
Well then the cricket opens the book and so then what do you see? Well what does that look like?
What does it look like? What does it remind you of?
OK so that's the Van Gogh painting.
It's the Nativity scene.
It's the Christmas star!
And you know that because what's going to happen? Well the hero is going to be born
That's what happens and so a star signifies that
Why does a star signify the birth of an infant? Let's say.
Well because there is something miraculous about the birth of an infant and
why would the infant be a saviour? Which is the Christian notion say.
Well because that's the infant is potentially
Every infant.
and so that's how you should act about them
and you know one of the things that really is interesting about having little kids
And I loved having little kids is that
You have this opportunity to have this pristine relationship with someone like
Like a relationship you have never had with anyone because the kid really
is just there to love you
If you don't screw it up you've got that
and then you can keep that going you know and you can try keep that relationship
like pristine and that's so fun it's so fun to try to do that it's
It's really
it's amazing it's an amazing thing and
you know kids get a bad rap in our society but
it's an amazing thing to have little kids
and they are remarkable and they give you back far more than they require from you and
partly because they treat you like you're
valuable beyond belief that's what the kid think about you it's like
That's pretty good.
So yeah it's like something divine is going to happen and so OK fine you know fair enough!
Well there is the star signifying that and that's associated with  in some way with this star that you are supposed to wish upon
Well that's kind of odd there's this
There is this relationship that is implicit the star that signifies the birth of the hero is the same star that you wish upon
Well perhaps the star that you are wishing upon is the wish that the hero will be born in your soul
It's something like that you are aiming at an ideal it's the ideal you whatever that would be well?
You can certainly figure out what it isn't.
That's where you start as far as I can tell
You know what you shouldn't be doing
and you could at least stop doing those things and then see what happens you know
If you ask yourself it's a meditative exercise you know
And you do this with the autobiography  to some degree it's like OK
Sit down for ten minutes and have a little dialogue with yourself
Like you actually wanted to know the answer you know
So you ask!
Well I am probably doing something stupid that if I could quit doing my life would be better that I could quit doing that I would quit doing.
And maybe it's not a very big thing because you are not very disciplined but maybe there is something?
Ask yourself that question man you will have an answer in no time flat.
Like I should stop doing this well yeah yeah I know and I could and I won't or maybe I would but if I did I know my life would be better
It's like you could figure that out immediately and if you do that a hundred times
Well you  will be in way better shape.  So if you don't know what
to do that is good you could at least figure out what you shouldn't do that's just moronically
you know pathetic and you can be sure you're doing at least a dozen of thoee things at least
You know procrastinating or you know
you know that's what the conscience tells you and if you ask it it will just tell you why you are you know are stupid and insufficient.
And so who wants to hear that? But
but maybe you could do something about it.
Ok so the cricket comes into the village there and he sees this little house and
there is a little fire in it and so it's kind of got it's a welcoming place it's a light in the darkness
this house just like the star and so he hops towards it and then he ends up inside it and
you know there is a nice fire you get to see the inside and
the inside is cozy you know it's welcoming and then when you look around you see that everything is kind of
in it's place it's not hyper-organized or any thing like that it's
it's friendly and welcoming and it's there is a lot of wood and there is a nice fire and
then there are toys everywhere and they are well constructed so you know that whoever lives there likes children
and so if someone likes children well someone that doesn't like children it's like you should run away from them very rapidly
but if they like children well then that's a good sign that you know
Jesus they are a least human it's a start you know and then these things are all
high quality they are made very well and then there's and he is looking around to see all of this and there's
there's toys and clocks and they are all hand made and
so he is sort of infers that maybe there is a wood carver who lives there and
a wood carver is someone who can build things and
and it you build things that work and that are beautiful that's a kind of truth right? It's like
it's built right into the object that's what quality is quality is the building into an object of truth
the thing works it does what it is supposed to it has integrity and so
you see that everywhere in here and
So you are getting the sense of that the film makers are setting the stage
and so
well so they set the stage by showing you the stage and the cricket tells you what he sees and he's
pretty happy to be there because
and this is also someone who is concerned about time right because there are a lot of clocks there are a lot of clocks
And so time turns out to be an important sub-element of this story
And then he sees the puppet he's a marionette and so what's a marionette?
Well a marionette and he's sitting on the shelf.
A marionette is something that is quasi-animated because it can move
It doesn't really have a soul but sort of acts like it has a soul
In the sense of anima and soul and animated and
but a marionette is something that is being
manipulated by something else behind the scenes
Right it doesn't have it's own volition
It's dependent on the will of something behind the scenes
And so there is a strong implication that whatever this thing is it's half formed
and that it's being manipulated by unseen forces behind
unseen forces
behind the facade
Well that is a Freudian idea that's you that's all of you you know you're pulled hither and fro
by unconscious forces and some of those are biological
and some of them are cultural you know and you think about people who are swept
up in great ideological movements like the communists or the fascists those people are marionettes
That's exactly what they are they all say the same thing they all mouth the same words
they all act the same way and something is behind it
and the question is what?
Well that is the question and that's partly what this movie tries to figure out. So
you see this marionette he's a half formed wooden headed puppet
and he has a little bit of potential you know and the cricket goes up and interacts with him
and sees that he is made out of pretty good wood and makes a little joke about having a wooden head
and you know that's kind of obvious what that means and
you notice that the cricket is dressed like a tramp
and when you first saw him he wasn't he was dressed like a 1920's millionaire
So but here he is a tramp and this is so interesting it's like
So this bug that's a messiah that's the introduction to the book
that's the conscience is also a tramp with no home it's like what does that mean?
And it took me a long time to sort that out and it's like
He has been everywhere this tramp he has been everywhere and
and he know he's traveled the world and but he doesn't have a place he doesn't have a home
He hasn't made a relationship with anything real yet he is kind of a potential
And this is one of the things that is really interesting  about this movie because
if you think about the cricket as a fragment of the hero
and say a reflection of the saviour which is his relationship with J.C. of course
and the person who introduces the book
then the story gets strange because
if it was merely a representation of the perfect person the archetype of the hero
then the conscience would know everything right?
And it would just tell the puppet what to do and that would be the end of it
But that's a dull story it's like perfect conscience comes along puppet does everything it says
Bingo! Perfection.
But that isn't what happens there is this weird idea that this thing that has got all these attributes
Needs a home and has to enter into a learning relationship with the thing that it's trying to transform
It's so sophisticated because I could say You should do what your conscience tells you.
It's like well maybe not maybe that's not exactly how it works
maybe your conscience isn't omniscient and omnipotent maybe it's not God right?
It's a guide but it's maybe smarter than you sometimes
Maybe because it's society in your head
and obviously it's smarter than you sometimes because it tells you not to do something and you go do it and then
You get into trouble and you think Well if I would have just listened.
but you don't and that is interesting too it's something that you don't have to listen to
which is seems to be associated with free will it's weird if your conscience knows what to do
why aren't you just a deterministic puppet of your conscience
Christ! That would work a lot better you wouldn't have to torture yourself and you wouldn't make any mistakes so
why the separation?
Well maybe it's because the conscience is generic
and so it has to be taught it has to learn too and so what you do is you have a dialogue with your conscience
it's something like that and you expose yourself to more and more of the world and
you get wiser and your conscience gets wiser and you  mature together
and that's what happens in this story because the cricket starts out as a this tramp
you know that is smarter than the puppet but not as smart as he thinks he is that's for sure
and when he first starts to operate as a conscience he is a completely useless at it he babbles of a lot of cliches
about morality and then he's late the first day for his job and
he's just not very good at it and so
there is this weird idea that the conscience which is part of which puts you towards redemption
is something that you actually have to interact with
over the course of your life in order for it to develop as you develop
and so then I would also say that the cricket represents at least in part what Jung described as the self
which is like the potential
fully developed human being that sort of exists within you as a possibility but it has to be
It has to be manifested in the actual conditions of your life
and the conscience has to learn how to position itself here and now
and it's got generic advice and that's not good enough
and so that's why the cricket is looking for a home and so he needs a home.
Even though he is all these other things we already says he was he has to find a specific home before he can become
who he could be
Well so  then Geppeto shows up and he is kindly old guy which is pretty much exactly what you would expect and
you know he's a careful craftsman and he likes kittens and you know that's always a good thing
and he has some fish and you know he's
good at making things and he has got a sense of humour and he is kind of playful and so he is the good father
fundamentally he's the wise king he's the positive archetype of the masculine and that's what he is
and so he is culture in it's positive manifestation and he gives rise to this creation which is his puppet
which is what culture does because you are a puppet of your culture a marionette of your culture
and so maybe you could be more than that
and that's the other thing that is strange about this movie and it's strange about the mythological way of looking at the world
because scientifically
deterministically there is nature and there is culture
and you are the deterministic product of the interaction between nauture and culture
there is nothing else to you than that that's that!
But the mythological world doesn't say that it says something different
It says that there is nature and culture and then there is you!
And the you that's in there has choices and a destiny
and that you actually affect the interplay of nature and culture in determining your own character
and it insists upon that the oldest stories we have there is always the hero and the archetypal mother and the archetypal father
there is always those three things there is never just two
So from the narrative perspective there is always implication that there is something autonomous about
the hero of the story and you know you can't account for that we don't have a good way accounting that
for that from a scientific perspective I was having a discussion with Sam Harris the other day which
was very
what would you say he said we got wrapped around an axle which is pretty much Sam Harris is one of the four famous you know
atheists along with Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins and Dan Dennet yeah
and so we were having a discussion and he is a determinist just right down to the bottom
it's like you are determined you are determined there is no free will
You're a deterministic machine and you know if you are a coherent scientist and you are
a Newtonian roughly speaking you don't really have much choice other than to think that way but that isn't how it seems to people!
And we don't treat each other that way and our entire legal system is predicated on the idea that you do in fact have free will!
So well can we account for it? Well no and do we have a scientific model for it? No.
But then I would also say that we do not have a scientific model for consciousness we don't know a damn thing about conciousness
Which is why Dan Dennet's book which was called Consciousness Explained
was referred to by its critics as Consciousness Explained Away
Which is exactly right as far as I am concerned because he took a mechanistic approach and
I just don't think you get to do that because
there is something really weird about consciousness I mean
the phenomanologists like Heidegger who tried to radically transform Western philosophy right from the bottom up
He basically said Well you know you can treat the world as if consciousness is primary and that
human experience is reality that's reality
and that it down't exist independently of consciousness in any explicable way
It's like well  what's out there if there is nothing to experience it.
Well everything at once it is something like that it's not really comprehensible as
without a subject the subject defines it and makes it real. Now you don't have to believe that but
at least I am telling you that there are thoroughly coherent philosophical positions that make that case
very strongly and that allow consciousness to exist as a phenomena and to take it seriously and
you certainly act like you take it seriously you act like there is a you and you make choices and
you certainly treat other people that way
deterministic or not you are still going to get angry when you know rude to you and
you are going to act as if they had some choice in the matter.
Now maybe that's an illusion possibly but maybe it's not.  And I would say the oldest stories that we have
always include that as not only the a fundamental element but even as the fundemental element
So well so you can think about that how ever you want but
Anyways so Geppetto comes along and he is going to finish off the puppet
And so what does he do to finish off the puppet he gives it a voice!
He gives it a mouth! Well that's really really interesting so
In Genesis in Genesis
this is a very very complex idea and it took people thousands of years to figure this idea out
and it's something like this so
At the beginning of everything there was chaos and that was like potential it was something like potential
the potential for being and God who is God the Father in the Genesis account
uses a faculty that he has which is the word to call being from chaos.
And that's the creation of being right it's the manifestation order from chaos
and it's the word the Logos that  it's the Logos that's the tool that God uses to do that and that Logos
in Christianity is associated with Christ which is a very weird thing but the reason for that is that
there is an idea that the divine element of the individual
is the thing that uses language communicative language to call the world into being
And that is what we do as far we can tell you make a decision you think it through you talk it over with your friends
you plot a course and the world manifests itself in relationship to you choice
and it's for that reason and it is for that reason that in Genesis and many other accounts
that Logos capacity is identified with human beings it's like you have a small bit of that in you
whatever that means and you participate in the process of
continually generating order out of chaos and sometimes the reverse you mediate between them
And so that in our in Western culture and it is certainly the case in other cultures as well that
that's why you have rights! Fundamentally that's why the law has to respect you
is because you have got this spark of divinity in you that's transcendent that nobody gets to transgress against
And you say Well do you believe that? It's like well you act like you believe it!
You treat other people like you believe it or they are not very happy with you
So it depends on what you mean by believe well you act it out. Well do you accept it as a proposition? Well
I don't care if you accept it as a proposition frankly because I think the best indicator of what you believe
is how you act not what you say.
Because what do you know about what you know hardly anything.
And so actions speak louder than words and if you want to be treated properly by someone is that you want to treat them
You want them to treat you as a valuable autonomous entity that's what you want
And so maybe you're not that maybe you are a deterministic puppet
and what this strange movie suggests is that you are a kind of deterministic puppet but you don't have to be
Alright
well the mouth goes on and then Geppetto is happy about that and then they have a little dance you know they
They turn the music on and all these little music boxes and
they all play together and it's like
harmony of some sort has been established because that's what the music represents and
there are layers of reality that are communicating with one another because that's what the music represents and then they have a little dance
and the idea is that well it's a good thing to let this puppet have it's own voice
Well that's an interesting idea because what the  hell does it know it's a wooden headed marionette
Why the hell would you want something like that to talk?
Well it's the same question you have in relationship to you children
It's like what do they know they are two or three you know they don't know anything
Well so should you just tyrannize them and make them do everything that you want or are you going to let them have a bit of a voice?
And the question is whether you want them to be a puppet or not.
And if you don't want them to be a puppet if you want them to grow up autonomous then then you let them have a voice.
And you facilitate the development of that voice and so
and that's and that's what you do if you don't want a marionette
So and Geppetto doesn't want a marionette so he gives the puppet a voice even though he knows it's just a puppet
and that it doesn't know anything
And then this is fantastic the cricket is sitting up there watching that he is pretty happy with it
that's the first little scene you see there and he is sitting by this other thing that is just not happy at all
And that's the terrible father and you see it's a character that repeats throughout the
entire movie you see manifestations of the tyrannical father continually through the movie
in different characters it's like he is played out by different roles
And so first of all the cricket is so thrilled about this and then he looks at the frowning king there
Who is not happy that the puppet has been given a voice he is a tyrant right he is the representation of a tyrant
and a tyrant does not want you to have a voice
And so the cricket looks at him and says
Well you can't please everybody all the time
and it's just a tiny little fragment of a joke you know but it's. There is this old idea
I think that it comes from Chekov and the idea is that if you set a play up and there is a gun a rifle
or a pistol on a table in the first act it had better been used by the third act or it shouldn't have been there at all
And the idea is you don't put anything in you play that's random you never do that it' like
because this isn't life this isn't life this is a work of art and everything is connected and it is there by intent
And so this isn't accidental that this little king character doesn't like what is going on or that he shows up.
So anyways all the clocks go off and the music boxes go and the have a little dance and everybody is happy about it
And then Geppetto notices what time it is and there is a tremendous emphasis on time in this part of the movie
Because there are all these clocks going off and they are all telling him what time it is like 30 clocks go off and then he takes
watch out that and notices what time it is it's like the idea that there is something about time
going on is like whacked at you you know dozens of times so that you get it
And it's a little joke that he pulls out his watch and he figures out that it is time from bed
Well so now we are making the transition between the conscious world and the unconscious  world
OK so there is an intimation in the movie that everything that happens now is in the unconscious world
and the way you know that is that it's strange because the movie moves in and out this underworld
but at the very end when Pinocchio is transformed into a real boy
the last thing that Geppetto does is I think that it's Geppetto hit one of the pendulums and start all the clocks again
So it's as if what happens from here onwards is part of a dream
Now it's murky because Pinocchio goes to school and you know there is the next day and all of that but
and so those are sort of realistic elements but then there is the whole going down into the ocean
to find the whale thing that seems completely dreamlike
But there is an intimation that we are in a different kind of world and so
They all go to sleep including the cricket.
And so then Geppetto notices the star!
And because he is a good guy he makes a wish on the star and we have already
explained why you might wish on a star and what that might mean and he makes a very interesting wish.
It's not a self-serving wish in fact it's quite the contrary he doesn't wish that Pinocchio is an obediant son.
He doesn't wish that he produced someone who will work for him.
He doesn't wish any of that he wishes for what a good father would wish.
Which is that the creation that he has brought forth
would develop it's capacity for autonomy.
He wants him to become real he wants him to become an actual living creature and not and not a wooden headed marionette
And so you would say that is what your father should wish for you you know and I have clients
frequently whose father's weren't like that at all they were tyrannical or they were negelectful or
or the punished the person every time they did something good that's a real fun game.
They competed with them and undermined them at every opportunity they didn't want to produce someone strong and autonomous
They wanted to give birth to a slave and then diminish it as much as possible
And so that's bad it's not good and so Geppetto is not like that so he says Well I am going to wish for
something completely unreasonable which is part of that ideal idea right?
And the unreasonable thing is that this puppet could become real! Could actually take on it's autonomy and move forward. And so that's what he wishes.
And then they go to sleep
And then the cricket starts to become driven mad by the noises of the clock so it's like he is going into this state of hyper-alertness
And the clocks are clanging at him and Geppetto is snoring and
he can even hear the little grains of sand falling out of the hourglass he is becoming hyper-alert
And then he yells Stop! and all the clocks stop
Which is a pretty good trick for a cricket you know he is the master of time but also we are in a place where time has
come to a stop we are outside of time.
And one of the things that Freud pointed out about dreams is that dreams are kind of outside of time.
Now here is what that means is first of all they draw on eternal themes that's part of it
but you know you must had had this experience Freud noted this carefully in the Interpretation of Dreams where
you know you are sleeping and the alarm will go off  and the alarm noise is incorporated into the dream
and it's like the dream has been going on for an hour in subjective time and you wake up and you realize that it is the alarm clock
It's like and there is no reason why your dream time should be the same as real time because it is all going on in your imagination but
It's amazing in some sense how much can happen in such a short period of time in your imagination and so
it's outside of time the world of fantasy is in some sense outside of time and so the cricket
tells time to stop and it does.
And then the star enlarges
and it turns into this blue fairy whose got a celestial gown covered with stars
and who has got wings so she is some kind of ethereal being and like you don't have a problem with that
in the movie it's like Yeah sure I mean you know it's a fairy that came from a star that makes perfect sense. which of course it's makes no sense
whatsoever
right it makes no sense but you are willing to go along with it because
on the one hand it makes no sense and on the other hand it makes perfect sense
It's like the fairy godmother idea it's like Yeah yeah fairy godmother no problem we got that.
And the idea there is that well Nature comes to your aid it's something like that
It's the benevolent force of Nature is on you side now not obviously only on your side
because it opposes you as well but
And there is your own mother as well who is also Nature whose on your side and so
but there is an idea here and the idea is that if the father gets the wish right
the aim right for the child
then Nature will cooperate
Right and that is true I believe that that's true is that
if you set up your relationship your cultural relationship with your child properly
then they are far more likely to flourish and so you get the magic of Nature on your side by
establishing the proper aim.  And so that's what happens Geppetto says well this is what I am aiming at
and because he is aiming at it and because it is in the realm of possibility maybe Nature comes to his service and
that is how it works that's exactly how it works because when you aim at something
then you muster your biological forces towards that goal and if the goal is
feasible and attainable then you will cooperate with yourself
And so that's quite cool Carl Rogers would call that
What's the word for that?
I think he called it genuineness which is kind of weak
but I think that is still what he called it he sort of meant that that's sort of what happens when your
goals and your physiological and biological being are alined well and you're
and you can communicate both you are not full of internal contradictions
And so your conscious aims and your biological possibilities are manifesting themselves in the same direction
and so that would be good!
So anyways the fairy shows up and she is quite sexually attractive she is quite provocative
and she charms the cricket
who gets all blushes and like is all you know embarrased and
overwhelmed by this like figure of celestial beauty and decides to cooperate the conscience decides to cooperate
and gets some responsibility and so
the fairy allows the puppet to move without strings
So that's kind of interesting it's the intervention of Nature. Culture focuses the aim
and then it's the intervention of Nature that produces the autonomy
and that seems to be right I mean even though it's not that understandable it seems to be right.
And then so she
takes the strings off Pinocchio and you might say well that's partly because your child is not
certainly not just a creature of culture by no means your child has a temperament you'll see that right away
and that temperament will unfold
and hopefully it will unfold in a cultural context that's amenable to it and that the combination of those two produce something new.
He can talk
he can walk
and so the good fairy basically tells him that
he has got a bit of autonomy and now it is up to him to
like clue in a bit and act properly and learn the difference between good and evil and to speak truthfully and all of that it's a bit
propagandistic that part of the movie I would say but it doesn't really matter it is kind of the inculcation of conventional morality
and there's a fair bit to it especially that he is supposed to tell the truth
and you know he says he will and the cricket is listening and then
the puppet asks Well what does conscience mean? because the fairy says always let your conscience be your guide
and he says Well what does conscience mean? and the bug whose like all puffed up because he wants to impress the fairy
pops down and gets on his little matchbox and gives this like horrible little lecture about
how to behave properly that's just like ideological chatter you can hardly even stand listening to it and
it's supposed to be like that it's generic moral advice that anyone could give
that is kind of dull and also puffed up and grandiose he's just not very good at it
So that's why he is on his little matchbox there with his chest puffed out and so
he says That's just the trouble with the world today. [sarcastic falsetto]
and I think that's his opening line you know
He's diagnosing the whole world and you know the fairy she thinks he is kind of funny because he is
And you know  it's sort of there is a real interesting thing here going on because he's male and he's
he's all puffed up with his knowledge which is completely shallow and he is put in contact with this like celestial feminine ideal
and he just turns into a complete moron and that's exactly what happens to men it happens to them all the time
So anyways she decides to give him a chance and turns him into this conscience and all of a sudden
he's this 1920's millionaire so he's he has been ennobled  but then she tells him that you know
he has to journey along with Pinocchio in order for things to go properly and he promises that he'll be a good conscience and do it
and he already thinks that he can do it
and that's why he is on the matchbox podium you know espousing his morality but the reality turns out to be much more complex
So!
The bug has a little talk with the cricket [sic] the bug has a little talk with the puppet
the bug tries to tell Pinocchio explicitly what it means to be good.
And he gets completely tangles up in the explanation because what the hell does he know
and the puppet doesn't understand anything says anyways so there is message there and the message is
the kind of knowledge that the conscience and the puppet are supposed to co-create
is not something that you can articulate easily as a table of rules it's not like that
because life is too complicated to just have five rules that you live by and that will solve every problem
partly because the rules will conflict that's a huge part of the problem right
One moral guideline contradicts another in a situation it's like you don't know what to do
So anyways they decide that they're
They decide that they are just going to
He says Pinocchio says Well I will be a god boy. and the cricket says Well that's the spirit! and then well then
Geppetto gets wind of it and they have a little like horror episode
and then he finds out that the puppet can
he is autonomous and they have a little party which tells you
exactly what Geppetto is up to is the autonomy emerges and he is happy about it it
So it's stamping home the notion that Geppetto is in fact a good guy and that is in fact what he wants
So it's like the encouragement of your father is the precondition for the emergence of your individuality
And it also allows the feminine to play a role both as Nature and perhaps as mother
and so the combination of those two things produces the autonomous individual it's like that seems perfectly reasonable
So off they go to sleep the next day they wake up
and it's a new day and Pinocchio is off to school and that's a good thing too because
Geppetto isn't and he is really excited about it and so what that means is that
He's been parented properly he is going to go out in the world of his peers which is where he belongs
and Geppetto isn't to worried about it in fact he is pushing him out the door you know
It's like go you can do it this is the next thing!
The kid isn't cowering in the corner and cowering in terror with the parents freaking out about all the things that are going to go wrong it's
There is some faith in his ability so
he sees all the kids wandering by and Geppetto dresses him up and sends him off to school.
And so and so that's good that's a happy family story it's like Mom and Dad got together they decided that the
kid was going to you know be competent and autonomous and ready to face the world and so
out he goes and so he's like five years old at this point and that is where we get
that's were we are at
in the story.
And I think that that is a good place to stop because the next thing that happens is
anomaly essentially Pinocchio goes off to be a good boy
but it turns out that is a hell of a lot more complicated than he might think because
there are actually complications in the world but also malevolence
Right the desire for things not to go right there are people who are not oriented towards
the ideal in any way at all and Pinocchio is young and naive
and so he has no defense what whatsoever against this malevolance and that's you know
That's not unexpected and it also turns out that the conscience the cricket who is still not very clued in oversleeps
And so he's just not there at a critical moment
But I think that we will pick that up next week because this is a good point in the plot to stop
The child has entered the broader world and has to cope with it
And so he's prepared because he had a wonderful father and he had a magical mother
and so he is prepared as you can be he is even not completely a marionette anymore
but now it's up to him that's the thing now it's up to him his parents have done basically what they could
And that's really about right you know
It's wise I would say psychologically
Alright so that's that!
So I am going to briefly review some of what I told you last time
and then I am going to walk through as I mentioned I am going to walk through
the Disney movie film Pinnochio and which I presume most of you have seen
How many of you have seen it?
Yeah OK that's that'sso as I think I mentioned that is something in of itself right?
I mean the fact that you have all seen it means that it's an
production of cultural significance and because it's such a strange artifact
That's one way of looking at it it might be worth
trying to take it apart to understand why it is for example that you even understand it.
and so I offered you the proposition last week that we
view the world as essentially through a narrative lens
and I believe that we view the world through a narrative lens
because the fundamental problem that we have to solve
as living creatures is how we should act in the world.
and that means how we should act to maintain ourselves
but also how we need to act in relationship to other people
and in relationship to the broader world in order to maintain our self across time.
so that's a complicated problem right it's not just how you survive
it's how you survive now and next week and next month and next year
and 50 years from now and maybe your  your descendants as well
if the culture is going to stabilize
and then not only you across all those time frames but you and everyone else across all those time frames
It's a viciously difficult problem
and so I would say that we have evolved mechanisms to solve that
I think that is self-evident in some sense because for example one of the mechanisms that
animals have evolved to deal with the problem of social being
even if they are not particularly social animals
is the dominance hierarchy right or you could call it hierarchy of authority or power because
I think that considering human
structures social structures as mere power
structures is a terrible mistake it's a terrible oversimplification
because power is no means the only like force is what I mean
force is not a stable way of solving the problem of how to live together across time
the question is what is the stable way of solving how to live together
across time and the really is the question and it's part of the question that
I am trying to answer
partly because it's a perennial problem right we face the problem of
how to organize ourselves in small social units
without undue conflict and then we face the larger problem
of how to organize ourselves into large social units without undue conflict and that conflict can be
absolutely devastating and and frequently is
so
so then I would also say that the first way of solving this problem isn't conscious
you see not at all
and you know
you may know and you may not know that there are
there are different forms of memory
right
really technically different forms of memory so for example
there is short term working memory
which is the memory that you use to hold things like telephone numbers in your active imagination
it decays very rapidly it's only 4 to 7 bits
which is why
well it's why phone numbers are were at least
7 digits long you know you can kind of
manage that as a loop that and then there is
episodic memory and that has two elements one is semantic and the other is episodic
it's what's the name of that
mmm someone said something
[Student] Procedural?
Yes well there is procedural memory and then there is another
the kind of memory that you use to represent your
experiences to yourself so let's say it is image laden and the other one is semantic
and semantic is your memory for facts and those are quite different so for example
procedural memory
that is how you ride a bike that is how you play the piano
that's how you play jazz music if you are in a combo
it's it's the memory it's a funny kind of memory because it is built right into you you know I mean
so is so is the kind of memory that you use to represent your own life but it is much more malleable is some sense
so what that means is that in your procedures
there is information that you don't know about it's patterned information that you don't know about
part of that is how to act
you know like when you walk into a social gathering
you don't really think through how you are going to act
you know how to act and if someone asks you
exactly what it is that you are doing and why you could formulate a story about it
but the probability that that it's the existence of that story that enabled you to act that way is zero because
you have to react way faster than that and so you know have social knowledge
built into your nervous system because you have practiced being a social being for a very long period of time
and of course then that social being has been shaped forever really it's the right way of thinking about it
Now we know that animals organized themselves into hierarchies
and we will say of dominance because it is more true the farther back you go in time
at least since the time of the crustaceans you know  when we split from out common ancestor 300 million years ago and so
and it's true for social animals and non-social animals so
even animals that don't live together in groups
have to organize themselves into a hierarchy
in the space they inhabit songbirds are a good example and they have dominance disputes all the time
partly that's you can hear them having their little dominance disputes in the spring when they are singing because basically what they are singing is
I am pretty damn healthy and I am ready to go and if you are another bird like me you had better steer clear of this tree!
and the dominance songbirds
you know they don't live together crows are social but don't most songbirds aren't
the dominance songbirds get the best nest
and the best nest is the one that doesn't get rained on
it's not to windy and it is close to food sources and
you know so they have the healthiest chicks and they attract the best mates and
like it is really important where you are positioned in the hierarchy even if you are not
like a flock or a herd creature now we are more like herd creatures so it's even more
it's even more relevant to us  but there is just no escaping
a hierarchical arrangement in social being
that is social being
and and and it is evolutionary ancient beyond conception so
300 million years ago there weren't trees you know I mean so the dominance hierarchy is older than trees
so that is really something to think about and then you know when you are thinking about the reality that shaped us
say from an evolutionary perspective but also from a cultural perspective
what you have to understand is that that the things that have shaped us most are the things that have been around the longest and so you could say
those are the most real things
and you can't even see some of them it's not like you can come in here and well it's not exactly true
you can't come in here and see the multiple dominance hierarchies that are at work
You can in a way because
the chairs are set up to face this way and I am facing that way and
that gives you some clues about the social order here and you take the cues instantly right
you come down you sit in the chairs you organize yourselves according to mutual expectation and that's part of your procedural knowledge
about how to behave as a social creature
now
that knowledge is really really deep and a lot of it is coded in your behaviour
now and in other peoples behaviour as well
and that's you know. that's the expectations you have of other people and of yourself and a lot of those are implicit right
so
when we are interacting there's there is a very large number of things that you just don't get to do
and you know that too and you won't do them and that way we can act as if we understand each other
even though we don't because you are really complicated
and I am really complicated and there is lots of situations where we might really be in conflict
but because we share a map of the culture the cultural expectations
it makes part of our it's built right into our perception
you will act out that set of expectations and so will I
and if neither of us can do that even if one of us can't we are going to stay we are either going immediately devolve into conflict or we are going to avoid each other like the plague
and that's exactly the right thing to do
and so one of the really useful things to understand  and this took me a long time to formulate properly you know
you hear the terror management theorists for example and they have this idea that
your your meaning representation the story you tell about the world
regulates your death anxiety it's something like that
but that is not right I mean it is close to right and it is a smart idea
it came from Ernest Becker by the way who wrote a book called The Denial of Death which is actually quite a good book even though it is wrong
you know sometimes a book can be very useful
it can be usefully wrong and Becker's book is usefully wrong
because he thought that
it's the internal representation of your belief system
that regulates your anxiety and that anxiety is fundamentally
in the final analysis anxiety about death it's like well OK fine it is a reasonable
proposition but that isn't how it works you see
it isn't my beliefs that right now that are regulating my emotion
It is the fact that I'm acting out those beliefs which include implicit perceptions I'm acting them out
and so are you
and so what you're doing and what I expect more accurately what you're doing and what I want you to do
and the way I want you to react to me that's working!
so it's the match between my belief system and the way that everyone else is acting that is regulating my emotions
it's not the belief system
it's mediated by the social culture and you see if you understand this then
you understand more particularly why people
are willing to fight to the bitter end to protect their culture
it's not a psychological structure that they are protecting
it's a psychological structure and sociological structure simultaneously
so the social contract is
you have a set of expectations and I have a set of expectations
they are actually desires they are not merely expectations because as
living creatures we are desirous we don't just expect
and so you desire an outcome and I desire an outcome
and we agree to act in accordance with that
that's the social contract
and so people don't like having that disrupted
well it isn't because it psychologically destabilizes them although it does
it's because it actually destabilizes them
right if all of a sudden we can't occupy the same
specified domain of territory it isn't only that we are thrown into psychological disarray although we will be
it's that we will start fighting with each other like and that can kill you
it's no joke it kills people a lot like it happens
it can happen very easily that a cohesive social group can fragment along some fracture line
of identity let's say and all hell breaks loose
and you know that's what the Tutsi's and the Hutu in the in the in Rwanda
and those things can get out of control just so fast it's just unbelievable and so
and that wasn't death anxiety that was death that's a whole different thing
and that's the other thing that terror management people don't exactly get it's like
it isn't just that your culture and cultural beliefs protect you from anxiety
and say anxiety about death even it's that they actually protect you from death!
as well as protecting you from death anxiety I mean look
It's warm in here
it's cold outside
the fact that the culture is intact means that you are not outside freezing
that's a hell of a lot more fundamental in some sense than mere anxiety although
I am not trying to underplay the role of anxiety that's a major issue but
there is something that is a lot more fundamental at stake that mere psychology
so it's the match between your map of the world and  other peoples actions that regulates your emotions
and and it regulates it completely because
you know if someone in here starting acting seriously deranged
like brandished a pistol let's say
all of a sudden you would not be in the same place
at all
not a bit
and so what would happen well
chaos would happen
and chaos isn't just that you would get anxious that's not a good enough explanation
what would happen is a lot more complex than that what happens in some sense is that your body
and it does this it does this what would happen is that you would react the same way that a rat reacts to a cat
it's exactly that it's exactly that you would respond as if
a terrible predator had emerged in your midst
And so What is that reaction? Well it's not just anxiety
because when you encounter a predator
anxiety isn't the only thing that is useful that would just make you freeze that could be the worst thing you could do
freeze and well you are a pretty easy target
so you have to be prepared for a lot broader range of responses that mere mere
mere petrification
like how about a little aggression
that might be helpful you don't know it also might get you killed but
but maybe you could take the guy down and maybe that's a good idea
you know and and maybe you have to run so that's disinhibited as well
and maybe you have to think really quickly
and reflexively so that happens that's actively disinhibited I would say as well it's like
your whole being thrown into intense concentration on the moment
and you are burning up physiological resources like mad and so what will happen after something like that
if you don't develop outright post-traumatic stress disorder which some of you would
is that you'd assuming that the situation was brought under control
you would walk out of here shaking with your heart rate at like 170 and it would take you like
well it might take you the rest of your life
and maybe you would never recover but you could be bloody well be sure that it would take you the rest of the day
that's for sure!
and so
it's no joke when someone steps outside the confines of the social contract
right and that is kind of there is a philosopher named Hobbes
who I suppose in some sense was a centrally conservative philosopher as oppose to Rousseau
who is kind of his exact opposite
Rousseau believed that people were basically good
in their natural state so he believed that nature was basically good
and he believed that culture was what corrupted people
and so
Hobbes believed exactly the opposite he believed that in the state of nature let's say
every person was at every other persons throat
and the only thing that prevented continual chaos was the imposition of a
of a collective agreement that would be the social contract
that essentially governed how people would interact and that would keep that underlying chaos
at bay
my contention is is that Hobbes was correct and Rousseau was correct and
and I think that if you add Rousseau and Hobbes together you get a total picture of the world and that's really
I think the picture of the world that I am trying to  relate to you it's both at once it's like
well you can't just attribute human
malevolence and unpredictability to society
it's a non starter
it's like people built society so all you are doing is pushing the problem back it's like
where did it come from
well the society the society before
well then the one before that it's like well
you got to tangle up the individual in there at some point right because people created society
and so you can't just blame human irrationality and malevolence on society
well and also it's it's ungrateful for God's sake it's like
society obviously also makes you peaceful part of the reason you are peaceful right now all of you is because
well you are not that hungry
you are certainly not starving to death you would be a very very different person if you were starving right now
you know or if you were enraged or if you were panicking or if you were terrified
because your future was radically uncertain I mean you are not just
any of those people right now you're
satiated and I mean that technically you're satisfied
none of your biological systems except perhaps curiousity
which is a rather pleasant emotion
are activated in the least
and you know because of that you all think that you are in control of yourself
but don't be thinking that that's just not right
you mean if you look at how the brain is structured for example
the hypothalamus which is a really important part of the brain it basically
it basically establishes the framework of reference and the actions
the framework of reference within which and the actions you take
in order to fulfill basic biological needs
so the hypothalamus makes you thirsty and the hypothalamus makes you hungry
and it makes you sexually aroused
and it puts you into a state of defensive aggression and
it actually also makes you explore
and be curious and all of that's hypothalamic it is an amazing structure
and then
and it's really small and it's right at the base of the brain
and you could imagine it as something that has tremendously powerful
projections upward throughout the rest of the brain into the
emotional systems and the cortical systems and all of that like
tree trunk sized connections you know metaphorically speaking and then
the cortex has these little vine-like tendrils going down
to regulate the hypothalamus
you know and when push comes to shove
man the hypothalamus that thing wins!
and so you know you get people now and then
who have a hypothalamic dysfunction and one of them produces a condition called
I can't remember it it's not dypsomania
although it's like that it doesn't matter
it produces uncontrollable thirst
and so what will happen is that people that have this hypothalamic problem
will drown themselves by drinking water which you can do by the way
and so they just cannot get enough water
and there is not stopping them right
no more that there would be stopping you if you were suffering from raging thirst it's like
it's a happy day when the hypothalamus is not telling you what to do
and you know you live in such a civilized state that most of the time
roughly speaking you are tranquil and satisfied and
more or less you can imagine yourself as a peaceful
you know productive well meaning entity
but don't be thinking that's you would be if you were put in the right situation because that's just not right at all
so
you know lots of times soldiers develop post-traumatic stress disorder because they go out on the battlefield
they are kind of naive they are young guys you know and
It is actually is worse if they are not that bright it turns out because having a lower IQ
is one of the things that predisposes you to post-traumatic stress disorder but anyways
they go out on the battlefield and they see what they are capable of under battlefield conditions and like
you know we have been fighting wars for a very long time
millions of years you know chimps basically have wars with other chimps
the troupes right because the juveniles will patrol the
perimeter of their territory and if they find other chimps from other troupes that they outnumber
they will tear them to pieces
like and chimps are really strong and so when I say they'll tear them to pieces I mean that literally you know
hey tear them to pieces
and Jane Goodall discovered that originally in the 1970's she didn't even report it for a while because
she was so shocked you know
she kind of assumed like most followers of Rousseau that the human proclivity for warfare was
that was something that was uniquely human
you know it had something to do with our
our unique self-consciousness or our intelligence or something like that
she had no idea that it was rooted
that deeply
you know we split from chimps about  6 7 million years ago something like that and so
we were patrolling territory we were gang members
7 million years ago and you know
that's a minimum estimation because of course that ancestor
shaded back maybe 20 million years into
entities that were roughly primate like
and so territoriality and the proclivity to defend territory is so deeply embedded in us
it's like
the control center for our whole brain
and so there isn't anything more important to us I would say than maintaining
the
match between
what we want to have happen and what other people are doing
in response to our actions like that's that that's what we want
and as long match is maintained
then our emotional systems and I would say that anxiety is probably primary in that regard
our emotional systems remain
inhibited
they're on
they're ready
like a nuclear reactor rod are on
and the rest of the brain dampens them down but
it's like you don't want them to take time to start up man you want them to be on at a tenth of a seconds notice when it's necessary
and so you know that's kind of why well if you look at a wild animal
it's like its alert
you know it's ready to dart this way or that way especially a pray animal
instantaneously and it has reflexes
built into it as you do
that will respond way before you're conscious
So for example
if you happened to be walking down a trail and you detect something snake like in the periphery you will leap away
before even know that you leapt
and that's because it takes a fair bit of time to actually see a snake
by which I mean form a conscious representation of the snake
you know and maybe it takes a 1/4 of a second or something like that
or even longer
but it doesn't matter maybe it takes a tenth
a twentieth of a second a tenth of a second but the thing about the damn snake is that it's way faster than that
it's really fast that thing and it co-evolved with primates by the way
and so it can nail you way faster that you can look at it so you have
your eyes map snake like objects right onto your reflexes so that
the eyes go the eyes make you jump
and then they see after that yeah well now you can see that's no problem
so
alright
alright
now what I would say that what we do is that we live in a shared story
and the story is a way of looking at the world and it's a way of acting in the world at the same time
and that story has to operate within narrow parameters
and this is something that is extraordinarily important to understand
because and this is something I think that Piaget figured out Jean Piaget
figured out better that anyone else I think that he really got this right and
by the way one of the things that Piaget was trying to do
you never hear about how strange these great thinkers are
Piaget was a very strange guy and he was a
he was a hyper-genius he was offered the
curatorship of a bloody museum when he was 10 years old you know because he wrote this little paper
on mollusks which apparently was very good and
so they offered him the curatorship of a museum and his parents wrote back and said Well you know
no probably not because he is actually ten.
and so that was Piaget man the guy was a genius
and you know he was actually motivated by the desire to reconcile science and religion
that was actually was his entire
motivation for what did you never hear that but that is the case
Piaget was very interested in how
you produce structures that enable you to regulate yourself
because you are kind of like a
a colony of strange sub-animals that have to figure out how to get along
so that you can sort of be one thing
you kind of learn that I would say between the ages of 2 and 4
as you are being socialized you know how erratic 2 years old's are I mean they are a blast and
and it's part because they are erratic it's like
they are unbelievably happy and then they are unbelievably hungry and then they really hot
and then they are really upset and crying you know and then they are really scared it's like
and all of that's just untrammeled so it's really fun to be around them especially when they are happy because they are just so happy
that it's just you know
you don't ever get to be that happy
and so it's nice to be around a 2 year old because you can kind of
feel that again you know and a lot of one of the horrible things about being a parent is that you spend
a tremendous amount of your time
making your child less happy
and the reason for that is that positive emotion is very impulsive
you know because everybody says well you should be happy it's like
well no when you are happy you are actually quite stupid
and so because happiness makes you impulsive
happiness makes happiness says Hey everything is   really good right now get what you can while the getting is good!
and so
as a like if you are hyper-optimistic manic we'll say
It's like every stock investment looks like a really good stock investment
and it's like you go out and spend all your money because
look it there's those wonderful things everywhere and you could do so great things with then and then
you know you spend all your money
and then you crash and think oh God my life is over you know because I just I just
spent all my money on all this useless stuff and it's all under the grip of impulsive positive emotion
you know and so.
when you're telling your kids to be quiet and settle down
it isn't because they're making a lot of noise being in pain
it's because they are running around like wild baboons having a blast! And
disrupting things like mad  you know and so well kids have to settle down you know like
Quit having so much fun!
and it's kind of awful that you do that but
but you do
and that's because the emotions and motivations have to be brought into
like a relationship with one another within the person
so that you know
one thing I remember with my son who was quite
he is quite disagreeable by temperament
which is actually a good thing as far as I am concerned although it brings its own challenges
and so with my daughter when she was misbehaving she was pretty agreeable
you know if she was misbehaving I could basically just look at her
and she would just quit you know but my son it was like
that was just nothing you're looking at me it's like no that's just not going to go anywhere man
so then I would like tell him to stop and
that really wasn't having much of an effect either
he would just sort of maybe laugh or run away
or whatever he was a tough little rat and
you know what I would do with him is that he would
be doing something and I would interfere and he would get upset and you know
angry and so then I would get him to sit on the steps and I told him this was when he was about two
I said look you are going to sit on the steps that's time out you're going to sit of the steps
until you've got control of yourself and you can come back and be
and play the family game again
I basically said be a civilized human being and they you are welcome again
and so he would sit on the steps it was so interesting to watch because
he was just enraged he would sit there
like have you every seen a two year old have a temper tantrum?
It's really quite the bloody phenomena
if you ever saw an adult do that you would like you would call 911
right away it's like oh my God! and I have seen adults do that you know because
people say with borderline personality disorder will have temper tantrums and it's like
man you want to about 30 feet away from that person that's for sure it's really but
in kids it's like
well first of all they are only this long so how much trouble can they really cause
but it's like you know they're just completely gone they are like
on the floor their face is red they are just furious like way more furious than you ever get
if you are even vaguely socialized
they are just outraged and they are kicking and hitting the ground and like it's like a little
epileptic fit of anger you know  they are completely controlled by their rage and
we took care of one kid for a while who
he was actually a pushover that kid you could get him to behave by
you know kind of shaking your finger at him but his mother thought he was really tough
because he had her fooled he had her figured out
and one of the things he would do is have temper tantrums and during the temper tantrum
he would hold his bloody breath until he turned blue!
it's like try that like you know as that's your homework
go home and go home and have a temper tantrum and while you are doing it hold your breath
until you actually turn blue
it's like you won't be able to do it
you don't have the willpower of a two year old
that's for sure that little varmint man he would just have a fit
then he would hold his breath and then he would turn blue it was like Wow! that's that's amazing
and we would just let him do it and you know
he would turn blue and everybody would be gone and he would come out if it you know and
it didn't work so he just quit doing it I think he did it like twice and then he figured out oh well
that's a lot of work for very little outcome and you know it's not like two year old's are stupid they're
they're not stupid but they are probably smarter you
but they are not civilized by any stretch of the imagination and so anyways back to my son
I would put him on the steps and he'd be like RRRRRR! just like enraged!
and and trying to get himself together you know
and I'd wait a few like I had a strict rule which was
as soon as you are done
you're welcome again
so it's completely under your control you
you can get yourself calmed down you come and talk to me again
if you are calm enough so I like you
then you are welcome back in the family no grudge nothing
and so it's harder that you think like people think that they like their kids like don't be thinking that
they are hard to like they are little monsters and they are very very pushy and provocative
and so lots of their parents do not like their children
and they do terrible things to them their whole life
so it's no joke and uh
it's very common and you know that was Freud's observation fundamental observation that
a lot of psychopathology is rooted in the family and you can be sure of that
you know and when you hear about some mother who's done something terrible to her child which happens reasonably frequently
you know perfectly well that
she has very terrible capacity to discipline the child has just provoked her
and provoked her and provoked her and provoked her and provoked her
it just happens to be a day where
her new boyfriend left and she is quite hungover and she got fired and it's like
that's the wrong day to provoke her
and then she does something that is not good!
And you read about it and you think Well how could that happen? How could anyone do that? Well
that's how they do it
and so kids they are very provocative just like little chimps
chimps will
the adolescents will like throw little pebbles and sticks at the sleeping larger males
and bug them
and that teasing which it is that teasing
turns into full fledged dominance challenge behaviour once the adolescent males get big enough to do it
and so when you are being provoked by a child which
they provoke you all the time they are trying to figure out well just
Where are you exactly what happens if I do this? What happens if I do this? You know and
how else are they going to figure it out?
Anyways he would sit on the steps and just
he is just enraged and trying to control himself and I would watch that and then you know I'd
come back after about two minutes or whatever and he would still be RRRRRRR!
and I would say well you know have you got yourself under control
are you ready to get of the steps? And he would go NOOOO! NOT YET!
and then you know he would get himself under control
and then he would come back and you know he'd be contrite
and then I would like him right away you know
you got to watch that you know because you don't like being dominated by a two year old no one does
and so if the child hasn't
mastered himself and started to act in accordance with the prevailing social norms
you won't like them well you think Yeah I will because I am a good person. It's like no you won't
and no you are not a good person so don't be thinking about that at all it's just not true
so
when he was contrite then he'd come and then you know we would just go on like nothing had happened
because that is what you want to do right as soon as you get compliance
especially if the compliance is in the best interests of the child
you want to reward it instantly right that's the right thing to do
because so then
and
you could just see him gaining control over himself and so what was really was happening is
His in his mind in his brain we'll say there was a war between the psyche the ego that was starting
to become integrated you know and starting to become a continuous person an identity
and it is fragile in two year old's and it can be disrupted all the time and it is that's why they are so
hyper-emotional it's fragile that little ego
and it doesn't have a lot of power
and so what you want to do is reward it when it wins!
You know when it he gets control over the underlying motivations you want to say
Hey good work man! Good work kid!
You did it you know you got yourself under control way to be! And the kid is really happy about that because
it's actually not that much fun to have a temper tantrum
It's exhausting you know it takes you over
it's a great thing to know with people like in your relationships
here is the key to a good relationship it's not the only one but
Watch your person
carefully carefully carefully and whenever they do something that you would like them to do more of
tell them that that was really good and mean it and it's not manipulative because if it's manipulative it won't work
It's like you have to say Wow! I am so glad you did that! And you have to be precise
Here is what you just did that I though was great!
and then Oh boy that's so nice that you noticed I can't believe that noticed It's like
you know you do that twenty times and the person will be
like the rat that's just pushing the lever for cocaine you know
so but no I'm serious Skinner established this B.F. Skinner noticed this a long time ago
Reward is intensely useful in terms of modifying behaviour but the problem is is that
it's really hard to notice when things are going right.
Right because you are kind of primed to notice when things are going wrong and so you use
threat and punishment more often as
agents of shaping the people that you are around because you know when everything is going right
what are you going to say everything is going right
it turns to zero you just assume it
and that's that's not good
that's not good you want to pay attention and if your person your children your wife
whoever your mother
your sister
if you want them to
if you want to rectify your relationships with them and I am not saying to do this in a manipulative way it won't work
but if they do something that's promoting harmony and peace and goodwill it's like
attend to it tell them that you noticed it's like
so useful and you have to get rid of grudges and your resentment to do that
right because you don't want to you are kind of mad at your sister
and then you know she does something good you think there is no goddamn way I am going to reward her for that
so you ignore her when she does something good it's like
that's brilliant that is because then you just punished her for doing what you want
and people do that with their kids all the time
you know because they let the kids dominate them then they get resentful
then the kid will run up to them to show them something that's kind of spectacular and they'll
they are not happy they'll like Oh yeah that's I'm working.
You know little kids
all sad about that and he has just learned something
so and it's not perhaps what you want him to learn
and so you have to keep your relationship with your children pristine
and that means that you can't
hold a grudge or resent them and that means that you have to help them learn how to behave
so that you like them
and that way if you like them
and you are kind of sensible and maybe your partner also likes them so you know you have got a consensus going there
there is a reasonable possibility that other people will actually like them too
including other children and then the world open up to them
you know then you'll bring them to peoples houses and the people will actually smile at them
and give them a pat on the head instead of thinking Oh my God that brats coming to visit again
I wonder what he will break this time.
You know and that's just a horrible thing for your child to experience repetitively
in situation after situation
all they learn is that adults have a false smile but they are really lying all the time
God!
It's like a bit of hell and there's a lot of children who are trapped in that it's really awful to see
I can see kids like that when I walk down the street you know it's like
they are little doomed things and they're  they are you know they are screwed in 15 different ways and there is no way out of it
It's really awful
so
I would not recommend that you do that
It's better to notice that you are a bit of a monster
or a lot of a monster
and notice that
you are much happier with the people around you when they behave in accordance with
reasonable social norms and then you actually feel genuinely connected to them
you want to work on their behalf so that everything works out
but if you think that you are a good person and that you would never do anything that was
harmful to your children then you can just forget about that because you will never take it seriously enough to actually learn
so
alright so anyways we live inside this story as far as I can tell
and
you know we kind of put the story together inside us to begin with
and that happens between 2 and 4 when you are
integrating those motivations and emotions into a relatively functional unity
right and that does happen between 2 and 4
if you don't have your kids socialized by the time they are 4 you might as well just forget it
and I know that sounds terribly pessimistic and all of that but I know the literature on
trying to rectify antisocial behaviour in children and after the age of 4 it's virtually impossible no matter what you do.
and the reason for that is that
kids who are still acting like two year old's when they are four
you know they are twice as old eh as a two year old
that's a lot of difference like a four year old is an adult as far as a two year old is concerned
and so if the four year old is still acting like a two year old that's really not good!
and other four year old's will come up and you know
do a little play invitation like a dog and you know the kid the two year old four year old has no idea how to react to that and so the more mature kid thinks
Oh well..
how about I play with you?
and then that kid is isolated
from the peers and after four you mostly socialized by your peers
and so you just fall farther and farther and farther behind
you are more and more alienated you are more bitter and angry and no wonder
and it's just not you can't rectify it
so
so
so that's useful to know it's like your job from two to four
is to turn your child help turn your child into a functional unity and by three they should be
functional enough as a unity
within themselves so that they can concentrate on a voluntary goal
for some reasonable length of time
which is also why it's useful to let them spend some time alone so that they can learn to amuse themselves
because if they can't amuse themselves they are not going to play with other kids
and then by three
they are sorted together enough so if another three year old comes along
they can at least play in parallel
and may also start maybe able to start playing
a cooperative game
and so that's often a fantasy game you know pretend
and so what the kids will do sometimes they mediate it verbally
but sometimes it's more acted out
it's a combination of the two
they will assign each other roles
they will do this with you too well let's have a tea party
well what does that mean?
well it means let's sit down and act out the act of sharing food
and see if we can get that right
that's what the kids saying we will have a little tea party
you know it's very important because human beings share food like this is a major thing to get right man.
And so the kid will say well you be the Mom and I will be the Dad and you know
we will make little fort and that will be our house and we will go in there and run our roles and
you know we are acting out
we are acting out family
and if we are both reasonably civilized as three year old's we can concentrate on that goal
we can establish that little fictional world
we can
negotiate a mutual goal
and then we can run the simulation and that is what kids are doing when they are pretending
it's bloody brilliant that's play man it's like
It's brilliant!
It's absolutely unbelievable because
you know if you are going to play Mom let's say
It isn't like you
it isn't exactly like you imitate your Mom because imitation would be
you know how annoying it is when someone copies you
so you know
you are sitting like that and then
and I do the same thing that's really annoying and that isn't what kids do
they don't
act out the precise actions that they have seen the target of their fantasy
display they're way more sophisticated than that they watch
they're mother let's say like hawks
and then they start to extract out the regularities in their behaviour which is Mom behaviour let's say
that's what makes you Mom
whatever that is and then
so it's like they look at you across time and they extract out the regularity that makes you Mother
and then they try to embody that regularity in their pretend play and then they sort of encapsulate or
incorporate the spirit of being a mother or being a father or whatever
or an animal because they'll play at that
and so that is what they are doing they are using their body as and their mind as dramatic forums
it's really amazing you know it's so sophisticated
and no other animal does that as far as we know
and it's the platform on which language is based first of all we imitate
and language is imitation right because we use the same words right so it's imitation
it's a big deal so you can act out someone else
and then you can conceptualize them in fantasy and it is only way after that that you
could maybe articulate it what does it mean to be a mother
so I could have you write an essay about that
well you would have to think about it right?
you wouldn't just automatically know but if someone hands you a baby you know you are not completely
socially blind you roughly know what to do after you are done with your initial nervousness
you roughly know what to do
don't drop it that's a good rule you have probably figured that one out at least
you know don't yell at it don't startle it give it a little pat maybe try hugging it
maybe you go like this you know you make eyes at it you know what to do!
It's built into you you know it's built into you but
that doesn't mean you could lay it out as a series of rules about how to be a mother
it's like you could right a whole damn book about that so
alright so anyways you live in this story
and first of all you get your own story together
and that's by integrating your motivations and emotions together
under social influence
you know
Piaget kind of states that
before the age of three kids can't really play
they are egocentric and it's not exactly right because
you are actually playing with you mother
from the time you are born so even with breast feeding that's a social interaction and
it's a complex cooperative endeavour and it's often hard for a mother and the infant to get that right
because it's complicated and it requires a lot of social interaction like the child has to learn not to bite for example
you know and a mother has to learn not to be too nervous and
and there is a lot of social bonding it's a really complicated social interaction
so the child the infant even at the earliest stages is already engaged in a complex social dynamic
that is essentially play oriented
but it's you know pretty primordial  it has to do mostly with the mouth and
a child's mouth and tongue are already hardwired at birth  so
you child is most this is a Freudian observation as well your child is almost all
mouth and tongue when it's born the rest of it's body well you watch infants  it's like
even when they are
How old?
Seven months? Six months? Four months? I can't even remember now you know they will move their arm and they kind of go like this
it's like they have no fine control they're
it's more like they have
you know clubs on the ends of sticks it's like that
their nervous system isn't thoroughly myleinated then don't have control over themseleves
but their mouth and tongue are already wired up
and so otherwise they wouldn't be able to swallow or nurse so
the oral element is extraordinarily important for a young child
that's why kids put everything in their mouth
you know even when they are a bit older it's like they see with their tongue
which of course everyone can do
you know if you put a block in your mouth you can tell that it's a cube you can tell that it is a cube without looking
so you can with your tongue you can see with your hands you can even see to some degree with your ears
anyways
so they're a social interaction right from the beginning but for the point of simplification
you might say well first the child
organizes
themselves into a functional unity under the
pressure of social dynamics
and then they get unified enough so that they can attain unity with another child by
setting up a fictional world
and cooperating and competing within that because that's quite interesting to because
you know people often
juxtapose cooperation and competition as if they are opposites
but they are not opposites at all
another Piagetian observation
so you say Well is hockey a competitive game?
and people would say Well yeah! but then you think really!
Really! No one brings a basketball
Right?
So we are going to play by the rules
That's cooperation well are teams competing against each other
Well yes! But they agreed to compete within a particular landscape
and they all cooperate to maintain that landscape and so
you do the same thing when you are playing Monopoly
It's like you are trying to win but at the same time you are cooperating
That's what that's society man! That's society right there!
You are cooperating
That's the big enclosure and within that there are regulated competitions
But to separate those artificially and say one is competition and the other is cooperation is just
It's just not. just not very smart it's not observant that's not how it workd
and games are intensely cooperative even if they are intensely competitive I mean
the  hockey teams are playing in the same game that's the cooperation then each team
there is competition within the team to be the best player let's say but everyone wants that
because everyone wants good players to emerge but still cooperate like mad with your team mates and if you don't pass
and you know play like a reasonable person then they're going to not be happy with you
and so
even within that competition cooperation is regulating the interactions and then you can think
this is a really good thing to think too it's like
People often say to their kids
doesn't matter whether you win or lose it's how you play the game.
and the kid of course has no idea what that means it's like what do you mean I am trying to win
and the parents says No no it matters how you play
and the kid pushes them and the parents really can't come up with a good explanation of why that is the case
They might say Well other kids won't play with you
There you go!
Because you could say
this is something to think about so
there is a game
and there is a victory within the game
but then there is the set of all games
and there is victory across the set of all games
and the victory that you attain across the set of all games
isn't winning all the games
it's being invited to play all the games
and so if you play fair
then you are playing a meta-game
and the meta-game is how to win across the set of all games
and so if you teach your child how to behave properly then they always get invited to play
and that makes them winners
and that's that!
and so if you understand that  you understand something
phenomenally important about the emergence of morality
you know because people moral relativist in particular think that morality is relative
and of course human beings are diverse just like languages are diverse
and there is more than one playable game but there is not really more than one playable meta-game
it's like you are either the kind of person that other people want to play with
or you are not.
and it you are not the kind of person that people want to play with then you are a loser
it's as simple as that and that's
true of all cultures they might be playing different individual games within their culture and undoubtedly they are but
the set of all games that they play is still common across cultures that's part of what makes us human
and then you could say as well
we are actually evolved to detect people who are good at playing the set of all possible games
and we actually know that that's not theoretical we know for example
some things are easy to remember and some things are to remember you know
Here is something that is easy to remember you play with someone and they cheat
Man you will remember that that's like in your mind that's not going anywhere
and so great are detecting cheaters and you remember
and that's because you can't trust a cheater and you shouldn't invite a cheater to play a game with you because they might cheat!
and so that's part of the innate morality system you remember cheaters because they good at playing the meta-game
and of course you're evolved
of course you are adapted to the meta-game because
you are the product of this immense evolutionary history right and
whoever your ancestors were
which is an unbroken string of successful reproducers going back 3.5 billion years
you think about that every single one of your ancestors
successfully reproduced it's mind boggling that you chances against that
are so it's billions to one and here you are the line of
3.5 billion years of success the whole world was trying to kill you that whole time and here you are it's like and but
you know you are still only going to last about 80 years
so
but that you know is still you know good for you so anyways
there were lots of games that your ancestors were playing across that immense span of time
many many you know lizard games and tree dweller games
and crustacean games you know the huge set of games
and you are adapted to win across those games all of them
and that's built into you man that's your central human nature that's what makes you social
and it's not some mere cultural construct
quite the contrary it's so deeply embedded in you it's what you are
Alright so well
this is a story it's a game too that's another way of thinking about it you know that's a Monopoly game well
what's the frame
well that's the rules of the game
and are they why do you accept them
Well it's kind of arbitrary right it's like
that happens to be the rules hockey has different rules
basketball has different rules but what they share is that they have rules
OK so there is a frame that's the rules and then within the frame there is a goal
and the goal is whatever the rules dictate you know there is usually
It's usually the construction of a heirarchy
of success within a frame
and so that's what you play and so you play Monopoly and it's like we'll accept the rules
that's the social contract and then we will each try to win
and that will be fun!
We find that amusing and if you lose what do you say?
Well you say there is always another game
and so that's great so
if you have that attitude and you play fair then it doesn't matter whether you win or lose
although you still want to try to win because otherwise you are not a good player
but you accept defeat gracefully because
you can play again!
and so and you will win some and you will lose some and that's not so bad you know and
even if you lose well maybe you learned something  and
and you're doing a lot more than one thing while you are playing Monopoly you know you are having a conversation and
learning how to interact with people and learning how to regulate your emotions and so
even if you lose if you have any sense you win
and if your kids have any sense they know that
and so that way you buffer then against defeat it's like yeah yeah you know
next time
it's OK
You should try but it is OK and that's useful information for people to know
so you are always in one of these little frameworks and there is just no getting out of it so
and that's because you know at any given moment
this is like field theory there used to be psychological theories that talked about the field of human experiance
something like that and this is kind of what that is this is a field and
basically what happens is that you parse out a little part of the world
say
and
an amount that you can handle
so let's say it has some duration  you are not aiming at something 50 years in the future
it's because how the hell are you going to to that?
there are too many variables you know
so your aiming at some handleable amount of time
and you posit a goal in there and you plot your route and then
that tells you what is up
and tells you what is down because up moves you towards the goal and down moves you away from the goal and
that's sets up your motivation framework so that
you have something worth attaining you know that's a really interesting thing to know too it's like
Why have a goal?
Well it's easy no goal no positive emotion.
Because you experience positive emotion by noticing that you are moving towards a goal
and so if you don't have a goal
well you can't have any positive emotion! So
you better have a goal and so you might say well what should the goal be?
Well we could start by saying well any goal is better than none.
And then we might say well it should be a goal that other people
will let you pursue because otherwise it's going to be kind of difficult
and maybe they will be even happy to help you pursue it that would even be better
and maybe it's a goal that would enable you to learn how to pursue other goals
while you pursue that goal boy that would really be good
And so you can see that your goal was parameterized
but that doesn't mean that any old goal works it means there's some goals that work nicely
and some not so nicely there are playable games and non-playable games that's a good way of thinking about it
and you want to have a playable game and there is a lot of them
lawyer plumber you know
actor whatever they are playable games
and it's not obvious which one is better but
it's certainly obvious which ones are sustainable and which ones are worse
and so they're is a set of playable games and you need to extract from that set of playable games
a game that suits you.
and that would be partly due to your temperament you know because extroverted people want to play an extroverted game
highly neurotic people want to play a safe game
agreeable people want to play generous game and
disagreeable people want to play a game that highly competitive so they can win and
you know fine!
but they're all
within the realm of playable games
and that means they are socially acceptable as well
and so that means it isn't just
arbitrary  it isn't just relative
what you decide to do it is heavily parameterized there is only
there is a set of playable games and it's large the set is large but
there are commonalities within it and that's why there are commonalties
that is why morality has a common basis
fundamentally and so that's partly what we are trying to investigate it's like
what's up what is up mean?
what does it mean is there such a thing now
one thing to remember is that
if you don't erect a hierarchical structure with something to aim at
you got no positive motivation
because you experience positive motivation in relationship to a goal not from attaining the goal
that's satisfaction besides it's fleeting
you know perfectly well you graduate from university poof! Next day you have a problem
which is what do you do next and that's a tough problem
it's not like you solved your problems by winning that game
you just introduced the problem of having to introduce another game!
so it's unreliable as a source of positive emotion but what's reliable is you set a goal.
and you try to attain it
and then that gives your life literally
provides your life with meaning
that's what meaning is now it's more than that but that's what it is
and so then you might ask yourself well
What's a really good goal?
Well that's what we are trying to figure out what's a really good goal? And now
OK so you got that so now I am going to walk through at least partly through
we will see how far we get I am going to walk through Pinocchio with you because that is what the movie is about and
it's a
it's hard to say how it come about like it was written the story by a guy named
Collodi [spells it]
it's quite a bit different the story that story the written one from the Disney version
the Disney version was a product of the collaboration of
geniuses of animation essentially so they were artistic geniuses
great at capturing motion and emotion and all of that
they were stellar at that
and imaginative tremendously imaginative but collectively imaginative
and so they put together a collective product
and you might say well how did they do that exactly it's like well
they were good storytellers and what does that mean well
it means you know the story that works and the story that doesn't
and maybe partly what you do is you kind of think out a story and you think well what is this happened?
Well maybe this should happen?  Oh! That's the thing! That would work!
It's like a little flash of inspiration right it's like
you got a piece of the puzzle that fits you think That will work there!
and then you talk to the other people and you generate ideas and someone says What if?
What if they do this? And then everyone goes No no that's just not believable no ones going to buy that.
and someone else has a little revelation they say Well you know it makes some sense somehow if
if they do this! And then everybody goes Oh yeah! That really
that really works!
It's like why?
Why? why?
Well you don't know you don't know why it works
but it works because
It works because it's the right story
and so what does that mean?
well it's kind of associated with this meta-game idea
you know there is a story that you should be acting out that works across games
and you have an inkling of it you have notion of it you have a vague apprehension of it
it's sort of built into you that's an archetype that's an archetype
and so when you read a story that works you are just entranced by it and you all know that
You go to a movie and it's a great movie and you are just blown away you know it's
a movie can pull you in
and turn you into one of the screen characters and like run you through a huge set of emotions.
I saw this movie once about
South America it started with this guy running out of a subway naked and he didn't know where he was
and it turned out that he had been
absconded by
the totalitarian death squads and he couldn't remember anything about himself and
he went back to his village and
basically what happened was that he ended up back in the totalitarian
death grip.
and it showed how the fascist state
had saturated the village completely and
so it was a tragedy and you could see with every action that
this amnestic guy as he recreated himself and remembered his identity
was going to travel down exactly the same road because nothing had changed
and by the time I wish I have looked what that movie was for years I've never been able to find it again
but when the movie was over every single person in the theater was crying
and not just a little bit they were just out of it it was brilliant
terrifying movie
and that meant that was something right about it man
and it got people and you you might say
you know you have dim apprehensions about the world
and some of those are instinctual and some of those are a consequence of your
of your experience and it's like
the pieces are fragmented but if you get away from them a long ways you can see how they fit together
but they are fragmented and then you go see a story and those pieces go
click click click click
and then you think Wow! That's what that's how that works out that's what that means
and that produces that overwhelming emotion and then and that partly how you make yourself
transparent to yourself
You go and experience a story and watch a story and you tell a story and you start to find out who you are by doing that
My nephew had a dream at one point
someone made a little animated thing out of it and put it on the Internet which is quite cool
So anyways he was having night terrors and he ran around like a little knight
you know k-n-i-g-h-t knight and he had a little
you know armor and a sword and he would run around the house
with a little knight hat on being a knight
and he was only like four or something and he had watched a lot of Disney movies
a lot of movies so he kind of got the knight idea it was
He was acting that out and he was having terrors at night right
and so he would go to bed with his little knight hat and his sword and he would put them on his bed and then
at night he would wake up screaming and that happened for a very long time and so
when I went to visit you know I found out that this was happening and
he had night terror so the kid wakes up with night terrors
screaming but can't remember anything generally speaking so
anyways this was happening and so
it happened one day and I was sitting with him and his family at the breakfast table and I
said Did you have a dream? and he said Oh yes I had a dream
I said Well what was your dream?
and he said
Well I was out in this field I was surrounded by the dwarves and they came up to my knees and
they were they didn't have any arms they had big feet
and they were covered with hair and there was a cross shaved at the top of their head and they were all greasy and they had huge beaks
and every where I went they jumped at me with their beaks
and there was lots of them!
and every body was very quiet after he said this because it was like
Oh that's why you were screaming at night it's like yeah OK!
and so
so then he said
But at the background there was a dragon and the dragon would
blow out smoke and fire and then it would turn into these dwarves!
so it's like man that kid had a problem right it was like
Well what are you going to do fight off a dwarf who cares! Puff!
Ten more that's life man that's life!
Really!
That's the Hydra
you cut off one head and seven more grow that's life snakes everywhere
and you get rid of one and there will be more
and so he figured that out!
It's a hell of an existential shock when you are four
and so he is like he is a knight he's thinking what do I do about these dwarves
well their are too many of them but there is a dragon
well so I said Well what could you do about that?
Right loaded question it implies that you could do something about that!
Well he kind of knew that which he was running around like a knight
and he kind of figured that out
and he said Well I'll get my dad
and I jump up on the dragon and I poke out both of his eyes with my sword and then I go right down its stomach
to the place where the fire came out the firebox and then I'd carve a piece of the firebox out and make a shield
and that would be the end of that! And I thought
Wow! Good work kid! Like
you really got it right it's the central human story.
There's the terrible unknown right fire breathing
generating trouble
and what do you do you confront that you confront that
and by confronting it you get stronger that's the shield and that's
that's what a human being is
and that's right it's exactly right
and that was the end of his night terrors by the way
which seems to good to be true but it is actually true
because I followed up with his mother for a long time and that was that!
He catalyzed that part of his identity
he adopted the role of the mythological hero
and that's what he needed to do because like there was a dragon and a bunch of dwarves
like what the hell are you going to do about that? Run? That's not going to help.
You know if you run in a dream like that
the dwarves multiply and the get bigger and you get smaller as you run
It's like that no a good that is not a good solution
and people do that in their life all the time and so the dwarves get bigger until they are giants
and they get smaller until there is nothing left of them and then
then there is no recovery that is not good
Now OK so now I also proposed to you that there is a symbolic structure to the world
It's a meta-structure I would say I think these categories are truly real
and their basically this! There's
unexplored territory and explored territory
and there is you!
and unexplored territory is the source of great riches and probably will kill you and
explored territory is you culture and it crunches you into submission and conformity
and turns you into a civilized being and
you are stuck with both of those and then there is you you know you are kind of admirable and cool and you do a lot of
decent wonderful amazing things and there are things about you that are just horrible
and you know about them and you are stuck with them and that's the world
and that's the the landscape of the world and what you will see
if you pay attention is that people who are ideologues like Rousseau or say like Hobbes
but it doesn't matter ideologues will tell you part of that story
so environmentalists for example will say
Nature that's pristine beauty
natural harmony
French landscape
it's a paradise especially if there are no people it's a paradise
and then culture is a rapacious monster
and human beings driving that culture against nature are
monsters of a sort that and perhaps there should be fewer of then it's like yeah yeah that's all true
it's exactly dead on right on exactly right
Was that movie called Avatar?
Yes that's James Cameron's movie right?
That's that story yeah and
Hey it's a good story
It's even a mythological story but it is only half the story
The other story you could think about it as a frontier myth that's Star Trek
or Star Wars for that matter mostly Star Trek it's like
but we will put it into the context of the frontier myth the myth that drew settlers into America say. It's well
there is a wild savage landscape out there that can be conquered by and settled and stabilized by civilization
and it will be the heroic pioneer who does it
It's exactly the opposite story of the environmental story which is why I think that the environmental story emerged. It was
you know the frontier story
had a lack in it it missed half of the world
and so the other story had to come up and it did
and if you take both of those  stories even though they are exactly the opposite to one another
if you know both those stories then you know the whole story
and it's really weird you know because one of the propositions of formal logic
is it's a fundamental proposition is that something can't be itself and it's opposite at the same time it's like
that's true for some sorts of things it's true for logical claims
but it is completely wrong in this particular situation because things are what they are and their opposites at the same time
and that makes it very very difficult to
that's why a dragon hoards gold it's like
What's up with that?
Well it will eat you!
And it will but it has gold!
So what do you do about that? Because it's paradoxical demands
well what you want to do is face the dragon and get the damn gold that's what you want to do
well
you have to be a paradoxical being even to do that so in The Hobbit
for example when what's his name
Frodo right? It's not it's Bilbo in The Hobbit
You know he is kind of this little underdeveloped
over protected Shire dweller and
he is called on a great adventure
to go and find the dragon and he has to become a thief
in order to manage it
Well that's pretty weird you know it's like it's because
as a good citizen he is just not enough to conquer a dragon
He also has to become a bad citizen in some sense he has to incorporate the part of himself that is monstrous
let's say and develop that and hone it
and that's to say that if you are harmless you are not virtuous
you are just harmless
you are like a rabbit
a rabbit isn't virtuous it's just can't do anything except get eaten
it's not virtuous
If you are a monster and you don't act monstrously
then you are virtuous but you also have to be a monster
Well you see this all the time Harry Potter is like that too it's like he is flawed
he's hurt he has go evil in him he can talk to snakes man
He breaks rules all the time
All the time he is not obedient at all but you know he has a good reason for breaking the rules
and if he couldn't break the rules
him and his little clique of rule breaking troublemakers if they didn't break the rules
they wouldn't attain the highest goal
so it is very peculiar but it's very it's a very very very very common mythological notion
You know the hero has to be
the hero has to be a monster
but a controlled monster Batman is like that you know I mean it's everywhere it's the story you always hear
[Student] Is this where morals become ethics?
[JBP] Meaning? You have to be more precise.
[Student] I feel like because every one is moral but  in order to become ethics you have to refine the morals you have to kind of go into.
[JBP] Well that's a good question you know because one question is
you know you are kind of implicitly moral in so far as you are socialized
but that is sort of procedural it's just built into you
this is different this is also becoming conscious of it
and expanding out your personality into dimensions that it wouldn't normally occupy so
this happens to people all the time
So for example lots of my clients my clinical clients are too agreeable
and they are generally women because women are more agreeable than men
but not always because I have had agreeable men as clients as well
and what happens is they're resentful and they don't how to stand up for themselves and it's because they're
very compassionate by nature and so if you entering into a negotiation with them they will let you win
Well that's not so good because you need to win to
Especially if you are in an organisation of adults
where there is a struggle right
When you have kids you can let them win
especially infants like you have to let them win and that's partly
why compassion is so necessary but as a
basis for negotiation between adults it's like
Sorry it's insufficient you have to be a bit of a monster so that you can say no.
And so a lot of what you do in psychotherapy
is treat peoples anxiety and depression that's a huge chunk of it
help them straighten out the way they think that's a huge chunk of it but another chuck of it is
well let's toughen you up you know let's put you in a position where you can bargain let's teach you how to
assert yourself and stand up for yourself and that's assertiveness training and it's a huge chunk of psychotherapy
and you need to learn it because
part of how you regulate your interactions with other people is to negotiate
and you cannot negotiate unless you can say no
you can't do it
and it cause conflict to say no and if you don't like conflict
which is basically the definition of being agreeable
then you cannot tolerate the conflict and so then you can't negotiate on your own behalf
and so then you keep losing!
And you are bullied and you know
it's not good then you get resentful and
and it's really not good so you have to
develop your inner monster a little bit
and and then that makes you a better person not a worse person
It's weird!
It's weird but
but that's just how it is.
Outside of that
diagram is chaos itself and that's the chaos from which things emerge now
I can't tell you much about that yet because it's do damn complicated
but I think the best way to think about chaos is as potential
That's one way of thinking about it.  It's also that place you end up when you don't know what to do.
It's the source of all things but it is also the terrible predator the terrible eternal predator that lurks beyond the explored domain.
It's a winged dragon
and it's winged who knows why matter and spirit that's partly what it is
and I will explain that later
It's also potentially the predatory beast that's been after us for forever
And the winged predator that picked us off from the sky so
primates for example monkeys have
some monkeys have three specialized alarm crys one is for snakes and that usually means
Hit the trees! And then one is for leopards and that means hit the trees and go out on a skinny branch
because the leopard can't get to you
and then there is one for like birds of pray which means hide somewhere on the ground so that you don't get picked off and it's like well
That's what that is that's what that is
and that's chaos
and it's expanded into much more than that
and then I showed you I don't remember if I showed you this but this is a symbolic representation of
Mother Nature Father Culture and the suffering of the individual but it is all that's all positive
There's no negative elements there
but that's OK
that's a partial representation and those things are sacred in some sense because
they are representative of an ultimate
reality of an ultimate reality the sacrificial individual here the suffering individual well that's pretty straight forward it's like
that's what that's life
that's suffering that's life
that's what happens to the individual so and everyone is looking at that.
It has power that idea
Well it's because you know
culture supports the suffering individual and culture is nested inside benevolent nature and that's
part of the story of the world
and it's the part of the story we are trying to figure out and make articulate we have been doing that
for thousands of years trying to make this story articulate
and it's not yet articulated it's only we are only getting it we are getting it
and we basically do that now with movies and stories and fiction and that sort of thing
We still don't have it articulated
I think Jung went close came closer than anyone else
Jung and Erich Neumann who was one of his students
came closer than anyone else ever has to actually articulating that and that's what Jung was trying to do
Is to take all these images archetypal images
Instinctual images and say well what do they mean? What do they mean? What do they mean?
And he got a long ways on that although his writing is quite obscure and it's obscure because
How the hell are you going to explain an image like that without being obscure? It's like
it's insanely complicated and it's not linear
It's not a linear thing that's why it's in a picture
Because a picture presents everything at once
and you want to take that apart linearly. Jesus! It's just it's just impossible.
But we have been struggling to do that really we have been struggling
From the time that we became self-conscious
You know what is the world about? How should we live in it?
Well that's a partial answer and it's a culture bound answer obviously
But you see archetypal representations like this in many cultures so for example
the image of the Virgin and Child that way predates Christianity
like the Egyptians that was Isis and Horus that goes back hoh we have no idea how far
thousands and thousands of years before the emergence of Judaism and Christianity
Way back before that and no doubt
back into prehistory itself! Because
a culture that doesn't hold
the mother and child as sacred dies!
Obviously!
Because obviously!
So it has to be held it has to be held as something
that you revere which at least means that you don't kill mothers and children it at least means that!
And that's an instinct you know it's an instinct it violates you to to that and thank God!
Alright
Let's take 15 minutes
So
I told you about this a little bit last week but you know one of the motivations I had for
thinking about the things that I have thought through
the motivation I had for thinking them through was because
Well I
It seemed self-evident to me let's say
and I think that it was partly from reading Jung but that just helped me clarify it was that
You know it was sort of Jung's contention that
We had an organic development of a metaphysical ethic
that was embedded in in religious tradition
and that basically unfolded let's say in the West until about 1600 1500 something like that and then
science emerged and we got unbelievably technologically powerful
using a certain view of the world
you know we are so technologically powerful
but we are still not very wise
and that just seem to me to be a bad combination
and I thought about that a lot it's like OK how do you handle the combination of
exceptional technological power and
and an impaired ethic let's say
something like that underdeveloped ethic or one in even which you have no faith because
you know it seems the foundational elements of it are irrational they're in mythology
they're in religion they don't fit well with the scientific world view
How do you rectify that problem? And
Well that's a tough problem you know it's a crazy problem
and certainly it was the problem that Jung was trying to address there is no doubt about it
Along with that went an associated problem which was you know what happened in the 20th century
which was so awful
and in so many places it was just so unbelievably brutal and terrible and it was perpetrated by
millions of people and they were individual people and they weren't that much different from normal people
and in fact they were normal people. So
the other thing that struck me was that it would be better if that sort of thing didn't happen anymore
and so I was trying to figure what the hell could possibly be done about that and
you know part of Jung's contention was well you had to understand yourself as a monster if you were ever going to
maintain some control over the fact that you are in fact a monster and that that could come forth if the situation is correct
Ok that seems reasonable and so
Well it seemed to me that  you know people had to become wiser
and of course that's a very difficult things to figure out because you could even question
whether there is such a thing as wisdom you know and
and then I thought well that's what the universities are supposed to do especially the humanities mostly in particular
it is supposed to make you wise that's what it's for
and it's a doing a terrible job of that in my estimation
it's more decimating people as far as I can tell and undermining whatever ethic that they have
rather than making people wise
and
but I think that we have to become wise I don't think that there is a choice I think it's a matter of survival and
it's more than that because if you're wise in your own life you are going to have a way better life
like incomparably better because you are going to
sleep soundly with a good conscience at night and you know people say that's worth more than money
that's worth more than money. I know lots of people who have lots of money and let me tell you
money protects you you are as well as protected from the world by money right now as you ever will be for the rest of your life
because most of life's fundamental problems can't be solved with money!
you know like rich people get divorced they have affairs their children get sick
they have all the problem you have and that's partly because you are already rich
And so
you might think that if you had a bunch more money  things would be better
but it's just not true in fact in some ways they might be worse
because money can open up
can open up the possibility of all sorts of temptations to you that you just can't afford at the moment
So well so economics we have already solved that problem fundamentally
and we are rapidly solving it everywhere in the world right.
The world economy is growing so damn fast that you can't even imagine how you could possibly make it grow any faster
It's crazy we have lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in the last 15 years you know
The U.N. set a goal by 2015 I think it was to cut poverty by half
if I remember correctly and they reached it two years early you know it's like
It's unbelievable! So
Well so then I started to
try to understand what it might be to
to live and really what I was looking for and was not so much to live a life that was wise
but at least to live a life that wasn't pathologically unwise
you know I thought of
the sorts of things that people were doing to one another in the
Auschwitz camps and in the Gulag Archipelago and all of that
horror that was perpetrated on
on people as definitely unwise whatever else you might say about it
it was unwise so then I though maybe there is a way to figure out how you could not do that!
And so that's
and I think that that's
my sense is that when you come to university to learn how to be a civilized person
which is what is supposed to happen at university
otherwise it is just a trade school and you might as well go to trade school as far as I am concerned if you want
to learn something that will get you a job it's like it's a lot
faster and it's more certain and it's useful
if you are not taught to be a citizen at university then
Why bother with it?
So well so that's what we are trying to figure out!
and and that's part of that
cloud of mythological fantasy that surrounds our culture that's
it's part of its deep history that we are trying to
you know if you grapple with the humanities and with art and all of that
that you are trying you are trying to master and incorporate and
pull in to you so that you're situated properly in history and
and you are not just floating in the void of you know this
tiny individuality that is divorced from everything else you are weak in that circumstance
Alright so
that's more of an explanation of why I try to puzzle through these things and try to puzzle through them with you
So anyways we talked about this song last week and
you know I made a hypothesis to you we'll go through this quickly
It's doggerel it's not great poetry but it is irrelevant
It was a very popular son it's quite beautiful
In the movie it actually sung by like a heavenly choir that's what it sounds like so
Its got this cathedral you can imagine people singing it in a cathedral essentially
and so that's not accidental it's purposeful
you know it partakes of that
what would you call it it partakes of that esthetic that's. that's it
So the film makers are are
implying that
what is about to be shown to you has this
divine element essentially and that that's signified by the choir of voices that sings this song
and the song says fundamentally something like this
is that if you lift up our eyes above the temporal into the transcendent and so that's
what exists in the heavenly world in the stars
if you pick an ultimate goal if you pick the right ultimate goal
then
and anyone can do this that's the other thing it's democratic
it's anyone can do this so that's the second proposition It doesn't matter who you are
You can do this.
And so I think that's a reflection of the idea of the divinity of the individual it's like
there is something about each individual that's valuable regardless of their idiosyncrasies  and
and so they have this potential that they can manifest and how you manifest it? Well
you pick the right goal and what's the right goal well it's high
it's elevated it's above the mundane
Now what does that mean? Well you don't really know you don't really know? That's why it is signified by a star and
the star is something that glimmers in the night right
so it's a source of light in the darkness
And so there is a metaphor in there obviously there is a metaphor there.
And the star is the star that that's the star of Hollywood
you know the person that you emulate that's part of it because an ideal
is it's going to be a human ideal of some sort that you are going to be aiming at
and so the ideal human being is the star that you are aiming at maybe it's something like that.
If that's what you are aiming at well you might say well What should you aim at in life? And one answer is well
Why don't you aim at being
whatever you could be that would be the best!
Now you don't know what that is exactly because how do you know
you know what you could think Well that would be really good if I could have it And then you could say Well
can I think of anything better than that? and if the answer is no then well why not go for that?
You know well you might say Well it's too ambitious it takes too much responsibility.
It's like yeah yeah those are definitely problems and
one of the things that I have figured out over the years is that if you offered the person the opportunity you know
because people say Well life doesn't really have any ultimate meaning. It's like
yeah OK fine let's say that it has an ultimate meaning
but that in order to
experience that ultimate meaning you have to take on ultimate responsibility for what you do.
That's a heavy price to pay to have a meaningful life.
You know and you might say Well there's no damn way I going to do that I'll just go for the you know pointless
I'll go for the trivial pointless perspective which is kind of hard on me existentially but it frees me up I can do whatever the hell I want
moment to moment I don't have any ultimate
responsibility.
and so then you think That's kind of a good deal. And then but that raises this weird spectre
of doubt which is well when you hear people talk about the ultimate futility of life
is it because life is ultimately futile or is it because they have decided that
they would just as soon not adopt the responsibility and they use that real decision which is to not adopt the responsibility
they rationalize that by proposing that life is ultimately meaningful (sic) meaningless
and like you know I kind of buy that I really do think that's what is going on.
So
but maybe not
but it could be that if you want to have an ultimately meaningful life that you have to adopt ultimate responsibility
Makes sense and what might that mean?
Well one thing it might mean is that
And I do think it means this is that
I think that it was Alexander Pope but I might be wrong about that who said Nothing human is foreign to me
[transcibers note] Publius Terentius Afer Terence I am a man: nothing human is foreign to me.
and that's a hell of a statement right because if you  think about all the things that human beings are capable of
and they are capable of some
like if you really want to know what people are capable of you should read about Unit 731
but I would not recommend it because if you read it you will never forget it and you will be sorry that you read it
but you'll know
Anyways to say that human is foreign to you that's a hell of a thing to say because
that means that what other people have done you could do
and that also means you need to take responsibility for that
that's no joke you know it's a big deal to do that in even a trivial manner
Anyways so the idea is you can elevate if you elevate you viewpoint to some transcendent
ethic that you want what is ultimately good you really want that whatever that is!
You don't know that's what you are aiming at
Well then it says this strange thing well what you want will all of a sudden come to you
well that's a proposition and it's the proposition that basically played out in the movie.
It's a hypothesis the hypothesis is the best way to orient yourself
in life is to orient yourself towards the highest good that you are capable of imagining
and then aim at that and then things will work the best way they can for you.
And I think I believe that that is correct it's my observation of life
has lead me to see that that seems to be correct
So for example
you don't get something that you don't aim at
that just doesn't work out and so lots of people aim at nothing and that's what they get.
So if you aim at something you have a reasonable crack at getting it you know
you tend to change what you are aiming at along the way because like what do you know you know
You aim there you are wrong but you get a little closer and then you aim there and you are still wrong
you get a little closer and you aim there and you know
As you move towards what you are aiming at  you are characterization of what to aim at becomes more and more sophisticated
And so it doesn't really matter if you are wrong to begin with as long as you are smart enough to learn on the way
and as long as you specify a goal so specify a vague one
I want things to be the best they could be and I am willing to learn what best means as I go along
Ok ok so fine and then you get
what you truly need we'll say well maybe not
[reading] Know that if your heart is in your dream
What does that mean?
Well that to me reflects this idea of a kind of integrated viewpoint.
One of the things Jung proposed was that as you
integrate yourself psychologically what happens is that
Your rationality integrates with you emotions
they stop being opposed forces like the Enlightenment ideas that rationality and
and desire are opposites and enemies in a sense
The Jungian notion and the psychoanalytic notion I would say in general
and the humanist notion even perhaps is that no that's not right
what you want to do is you want to integrate your rationality with your emotions and your motivations
They're not separable even technically
they have to work together and that all has to be integrated with you body
not only do you have to take your
heart into account and notice what is is that you want and don't want
but you also have to embody that you have to act that out in the world
So fine that's what that means and if you do that then
Well then your horizons will open up and
I also believe that's true you know I have known people in my life who are insanely successful like insanely successful
and those people are like they're
They're pretty damn together man you know like they are tough smart strategic generous you know they are always giving people opportunities honest
like they have got it all
and you know and sometimes now I am not saying that everyone who is wildly successful
Is wildly successful because they have got themselves together but
you know because there are people who are crooks and you know there are people who gain status
one way or another by nefarious means
but that's a lot more unstable than you might think
and I can't say exactly if that if you pursue that route
you are going to pay for it you will have your money or whatever it is but
it's not going to do much good for you so
And so it does seem to me that people that have integrated themselves and that
and that are pursuing a noble goal a high goal who
actually are able to do remarkable things and remarkable things can be done at every level
you know it isn't like you have to change the world
as a whole it could be that you do something remarkable within your family
you know that can be tremendously admirable you know someones got to take care of a family member if they are sick
you know there are heroic acts that you can undertake in the local environment
and maybe that will go unheralded let's say but
that doesn't mean that it isn't remarkable I mean
I have met people who are so damaged
you just can't imagine it and yet
Well one person I met when I was in Montreal
was this women and she was just ruined man
she looked like a street person and she was so shy she couldn't even look at you like
she basically looked at the ground because it was like there was light emanating from everyone else
and she was way too timid and humble to even to bear it.
And you know partly what I was doing was trying to get her to straighten up and not look so street personish
because it wasn't going very well for her in social interactions you know
but it turned out that isn't what she came to the behavioural therapy unit for
and she had her aunt I think she lived with her aunt who was like schizophrenic and then
her aunt's boyfriend was an alcoholic who like went on long harangues about the devil and it's like really man
and she wasn't bright this women she really wasn't and
You know she really didn't have a job and it was just like it was just not good in every way
and then she also had this unbelievable humility and
But then it turned out what she wanted I just couldn't bloody well believe this that
she had this dog and she used to walk it around she took care of the dog and you know that was a good thing and
and she had actually been an inpatient at the Douglas hospital which is where I was working and
they're were inpatients in the Douglas hospital and this was back in the 80's and
those people were like she was like Superwomen compared to the inpatients at the Douglas hospital
those people looked like they were from a Hieronymus Bosch painting
because they had deinstitutionalized everyone that could possibly be deinstitutionalized
and so the only people that were left were people who couldn't be deinstitutionalized
and so those were the people who were in the psyche wards for like 30 years and
all of the hospitals were connected by tunnels underground and the patients used to hang out
down there by the Coke machine and so forth and one day I took my brother down there he was visiting and
like it was just like he just turned white you know because it was just
really I don't know if you know Hieronymus Bosch he is a very interesting painter to say the least but
that's what it was like and so
So here was here idea! She had come to the behavioural therapy unit because she had been
she had been in the inpatient ward for a while and she met some of these ruined people
and she tried to get the hospital she thought
While I am walking my dog you know well maybe I could take one of these patients out for a walk
you know and she had been talking to the hospital administrators trying to get her
allow her to go you know take out one of these patients and go for a walk with her dog.
and basically she had come to the behaviour therapy unit because that's what she wanted to do it's like
Man that person she just blew me away like it's like
I just couldn't believe it like she had nothing going for her
like nothing
and yet she wanted to you know help some people that were worse off and like
there just weren't that many people that were worse off than her
Mind boggling mind boggling!
I never forgot it.
and it really really blew me away
you know there are opportunities for elevating your sights
within your realm of capability wherever you happen to be and
and that's interesting it's strange that that is the case
[reading] She brings those who love that's what that's should say  the sweet fulfillment of their longing
Like a bolt out of the blue Fate characterized here as feminine
and that's what happens in the movie the movie has got a Christian underbelly like
it's quite pronounced but it's really a pagan movie in many ways so for example
there is no blue fairy
and the reason I am speaking of Christianity of course is because this movie was
created in a culture where Christianity was still reasonably intact
and of course it was fully informed by that but
the underlying mythos is not precisely Christian even though it is informed by Christian imagery
There is this old idea I think it's  an Gnostic idea that
the wisdom of God is feminine something like that an anima which means soul is feminine
and so there is an idea like that lurking here
and anyways that's fate and that's the blue fairy in this particular movie you know she comes down from this star which is
kind of makes her a avatar of God that's the idea
and she's the transformative agent she's really Mother Nature
you know in her positive guise and
that's why she can animate
to animate something means to infuse it with soul that's what it means
and she animates Pinocchio right she is the force that frees him from his strings
and so that's her Fate
[reading] Like a bolt out of the blue Fate steps in and sees you through
Well what that means it means something like
It means something like this is that
if you orient properly in the world and we will say that you do that by trying to attain
the ultimate goal whatever that happens to be then it is as if the world is on your side
and and
and things go well for you and I also believe that that is true because
certainly one of the things that more or less self evident is that generally speaking if you tell the truth
things go a lot better for you and the reason for that is well heh
you want to be do you want to have reality opposed to you?
Or do you want to have reality backing you up? It's like it's a pretty straight forward question
If you are truthful to the degree that you can be truthful then reality is on your side
That's a good thing because there is a lot of it and there isn't much of you
Whereas if you take a  deceitful approach to things well then you're challenging reality
It's like good luck with that man!
It's like you are holding a plastic ruler in front your face and bending it you know and at some point
you are going to let go and it's going to all that force that you have
stored up and it's going to snap back and nail you  and that happens
Like I have just never seen anyone in my clinical practice ever get away with anything
Nothing!
And it's not surprising it's like if you are going to mess with the structure of reality
Like it's going to mess back and it does and it might not happen for years and you might not even notice the connection
I mean part of what you do in psychotherapy is actually
make those connections it's like why did this horrible thing happen to me
Well
Who knows?
It's like let's take it apart well who knows how far back we have to go
It might even have things to do not even with you it might have things to do with the errors in parents relationship
Like
you just can't mess with the structure of reality it
It stays warped until you straighten it out and
it's not good.
So so there and injunction here which is that you know if you follow this path you
pick a high goal and and you put your heart in it you know you commit to it
believe in it believe means to love believe and belove it's the same thing it's means to act out
and that's what the belief means  like we think that belief means to accept a set of propositions as true
Well that is one form of belief but
that's more like factual knowledge right belief is more like you decide that you are going to act something out
you make a decision and then you act it out and that is a reflection of you belief
You know you are staking yourself on something do you know?
Well no! Because you can't you can't know you are bounded by ignorance you can make your best guess and move forward
and you can do that with commitment but you have to believe in order to do that
I guess that's why it's a wish
Ok so fine
Well then we have Jiminy Cricket Southern U.S. slang for Jesus Christ by the way and the initial overlap isn't
a fluke I mean I am sure that the animators thought that that was funny and of course it is funny and it
you know in the Lion King you know that that baboon
whose the shaman basically well to begin with he was kind of just a comic relief character like a fool you know but
One of the things that Jung mentioned about the fool is that the fool tends to turn into the saviour and it's an archetypal reality
Bugs Bunny is sort of like that you know he is a trickster
and as the movie developed the character of the fool baboon took on the full fledged
you know  shaman priest element and
and you know OK Jiminy Cricket he is this little cricket and
and he turns out to be the conscience which is pretty damn weird it's like a bug is your conscience
and the bug is J.C. and that a very strange juxtaposition of ideas conscience insect
saviour it's like what's up with that
and so well what bugs you that's part of it
Well your conscience certainly bugs you
and you should pay attention to it's it's just niggling little annoying thing that you can't
quite you can override it right obviously
but it's this well he says when he talks to Pinocchio later it's that still small voice you know
and I have asked people before like in my personality class like
because conscience is a weird thing and it
and like  if I said to you
if you are about to do something that you know you shouldn't do.
Do you have a voice in your head that tells you that you shouldn't do it? So how many people have had that experience?
OK OK good now so other people have a feeling instead of a voice and so is there anybody here
who's willing to admit it who has neither the feeling neither the voice?
OK so you know it's a very understudied phenomena in psychology this conscience
I mean people can be conscientious
and maybe those are people who listen to their conscience more
I don't know but nobody has ever investigated it and
the fact that do this little voice whatever it is inside your head it's like what the hell is up with that?
You know it doesn't tell you what you want to hear.
At least as far as I can tell now you could say Well that's the internal representation of society operating within you.
That would be a Freudian view that's the superego
and certainly there is something to that
but
I don't think that it is necessary to presume that that's all there is to it and even if it is
you still wouldn't have the voice if you didn't have the biological potential
to have that voice embed itself in you.
So even if it is socioculturally constructed which it is in part
It's like language it's like your language is socioculturally constructed but the reason you can speak
is because human beings can speak and if you have a conscience it's because human beings have a conscience
and the contents of that conscience might differ but the fact that it exists
seem to me to be
universal. OK well so that's the conscience
and
that's Jiminy Cricket
and then the cricket opens this book then you look at the book
and you think Well what kind of book is that?
Well it's got a spot light on it
so it's being highlighted this is an important book  and what kind of book is it?
Well it's leather bound it has a lock on it you know it's not some cheap book it's kind of like a
you might think about it  it looks like something from an old library or maybe it looks biblical
Whatever! It's a major league book and this bug is the introduction to the book
So does that mean your conscience is the introduction to the book?
Well?
Maybe that is what it means it's certainly what's being played out in the movie.
Well then the cricket opens the book and so then what do you see? Well what does that look like?
What does it look like? What does it remind you of?
OK so that's the Van Gogh painting.
It's the Nativity scene.
It's the Christmas star!
And you know that because what's going to happen? Well the hero is going to be born
That's what happens and so a star signifies that
Why does a star signify the birth of an infant? Let's say.
Well because there is something miraculous about the birth of an infant and
why would the infant be a saviour? Which is the Christian notion say.
Well because that's the infant is potentially
Every infant.
and so that's how you should act about them
and you know one of the things that really is interesting about having little kids
And I loved having little kids is that
You have this opportunity to have this pristine relationship with someone like
Like a relationship you have never had with anyone because the kid really
is just there to love you
If you don't screw it up you've got that
and then you can keep that going you know and you can try keep that relationship
like pristine and that's so fun it's so fun to try to do that it's
It's really
it's amazing it's an amazing thing and
you know kids get a bad rap in our society but
it's an amazing thing to have little kids
and they are remarkable and they give you back far more than they require from you and
partly because they treat you like you're
valuable beyond belief that's what the kid think about you it's like
That's pretty good.
So yeah it's like something divine is going to happen and so OK fine you know fair enough!
Well there is the star signifying that and that's associated with  in some way with this star that you are supposed to wish upon
Well that's kind of odd there's this
There is this relationship that is implicit the star that signifies the birth of the hero is the same star that you wish upon
Well
perhaps the star that you are wishing upon is the wish that the hero will be born in your soul
It's something like that you are aiming at an ideal it's the ideal you whatever that would be well?
You can certainly figure out what it isn't.
That's where you start as far as I can tell
You know what you shouldn't be doing
and you could at least stop doing those things and then see what happens you know
If you ask yourself it's a meditative exercise you know
And you do this with the autobiography  to some degree it's like OK
Sit down for ten minutes and have a little dialogue with yourself
Like you actually wanted to know the answer you know
So you ask!
Well I am probably doing something stupid that if I could quit doing my life would be better that I could quit doing that I would quit doing.
And maybe it's not a very big thing because you are not very disciplined but maybe there is something?
Ask yourself that question man you will have an answer in no time flat.
Like I should stop doing this well yeah yeah I know and I could and I won't or maybe I would but if I did I know my life would be better
It's like you could figure that out immediately and if you do that a hundred times
Well you  will be in way better shape.  So if you don't know what
to do that is good you could at least figure out what you shouldn't do that's just moronically
you know pathetic and you can be sure you're doing at least a dozen of thoee things at least
You know procrastinating or you know
you know that's what the conscience tells you and if you ask it it will just tell you why you are you know are stupid and insufficient.
And so who wants to hear that? But
but maybe you could do something about it.
Ok so the cricket comes into the village there and he sees this little house and
there is a little fire in it and so it's kind of got it's a welcoming place it's a light in the darkness
this house just like the star and so he hops towards it and then he ends up inside it and
you know there is a nice fire you get to see the inside and
the inside is cozy you know it's welcoming and then when you look around you see that everything is kind of
in it's place it's not hyper-organized or any thing like that it's
it's friendly and welcoming and it's there is a lot of wood and there is a nice fire and
then there are toys everywhere and they are well constructed so you know that whoever lives there likes children
and so if someone likes children well someone that doesn't like children it's like you should run away from them very rapidly
but if they like children well then that's a good sign that you know
Jesus they are a least human it's a start you know and then these things are all
high quality they are made very well and then there's and he is looking around to see all of this and there's
there's toys and clocks and they are all hand made and
so he is sort of infers that maybe there is a wood carver who lives there and
a wood carver is someone who can build things and
and it you build things that work and that are beautiful that's a kind of truth right? It's like
it's built right into the object that's what quality is quality is the building into an object of truth
the thing works it does what it is supposed to it has integrity and so
you see that everywhere in here and
So you are getting the sense of that the film makers are setting the stage
and so
well so they set the stage by showing you the stage and the cricket tells you what he sees and he's
pretty happy to be there because
and this is also someone who is concerned about time right because there are a lot of clocks there are a lot of clocks
And so time turns out to be an important sub-element of this story
And then he sees the puppet he's a marionette and so what's a marionette?
Well a marionette and he's sitting on the shelf.
A marionette is something that is quasi-animated because it can move
It doesn't really have a soul but sort of acts like it has a soul
In the sense of anima and soul and animated and
but a marionette is something that is being
manipulated by something else behind the scenes
Right it doesn't have it's own volition
It's dependent on the will of something behind the scenes
And so there is a strong implication that whatever this thing is it's half formed
and that it's being manipulated by unseen forces behind
unseen forces
behind the facade
Well that is a Freudian idea that's you that's all of you you know you're pulled hither and fro
by unconscious forces and some of those are biological
and some of them are cultural you know and you think about people who are swept
up in great ideological movements like the communists or the fascists those people are marionettes
That's exactly what they are they all say the same thing they all mouth the same words
they all act the same way and something is behind it
and the question is what?
Well that is the question and that's partly what this movie tries to figure out. So
you see this marionette he's a half formed wooden headed puppet
and he has a little bit of potential you know and the cricket goes up and interacts with him
and sees that he is made out of pretty good wood and makes a little joke about having a wooden head
and you know that's kind of obvious what that means and
you notice that the cricket is dressed like a tramp
and when you first saw him he wasn't he was dressed like a 1920's millionaire
So but here he is a tramp and this is so interesting it's like
So this bug that's a messiah that's the introduction to the book
that's the conscience is also a tramp with no home it's like what does that mean?
And it took me a long time to sort that out and it's like
He has been everywhere this tramp he has been everywhere and
and he know he's traveled the world and but he doesn't have a place he doesn't have a home
He hasn't made a relationship with anything real yet he is kind of a potential
And this is one of the things that is really interesting  about this movie because
if you think about the cricket as a fragment of the hero
and say a reflection of the saviour which is his relationship with J.C. of course
and the person who introduces the book
then the story gets strange because
if it was merely a representation of the perfect person the archetype of the hero
then the conscience would know everything right?
And it would just tell the puppet what to do and that would be the end of it
But that's a dull story it's like perfect conscience comes along puppet does everything it says
Bingo! Perfection.
But that isn't what happens there is this weird idea that this thing that has got all these attributes
Needs a home and has to enter into a learning relationship with the thing that it's trying to transform
It's so sophisticated because I could say You should do what your conscience tells you.
It's like well maybe not maybe that's not exactly how it works
maybe your conscience isn't omniscient and omnipotent maybe it's not God right?
It's a guide but it's maybe smarter than you sometimes
Maybe because it's society in your head
and obviously it's smarter than you sometimes because it tells you not to do something and you go do it and then
You get into trouble and you think Well if I would have just listened.
but you don't and that is interesting too it's something that you don't have to listen to
which is seems to be associated with free will it's weird if your conscience knows what to do
why aren't you just a deterministic puppet of your conscience
Christ! That would work a lot better you wouldn't have to torture yourself and you wouldn't make any mistakes so
why the separation?
Well maybe it's because the conscience is generic
and so it has to be taught it has to learn too and so what you do is you have a dialogue with your conscience
it's something like that and you expose yourself to more and more of the world and
you get wiser and your conscience gets wiser and you  mature together
and that's what happens in this story because the cricket starts out as a this tramp
you know that is smarter than the puppet but not as smart as he thinks he is that's for sure
and when he first starts to operate as a conscience he is a completely useless at it he babbles of a lot of cliches
about morality and then he's late the first day for his job and
he's just not very good at it and so
there is this weird idea that the conscience which is part of which puts you towards redemption
is something that you actually have to interact with
over the course of your life in order for it to develop as you develop
and so then I would also say that the cricket represents at least in part what Jung described as the self
which is like the potential
fully developed human being that sort of exists within you as a possibility but it has to be
It has to be manifested in the actual conditions of your life
and the conscience has to learn how to position itself here and now
and it's got generic advice and that's not good enough
and so that's why the cricket is looking for a home and so he needs a home.
Even though he is all these other things we already says he was he has to find a specific home before he can become
who he could be
Well so  then Geppeto shows up and he is kindly old guy which is pretty much exactly what you would expect and
you know he's a careful craftsman and he likes kittens and you know that's always a good thing
and he has some fish and you know he's
good at making things and he has got a sense of humour and he is kind of playful and so he is the good father
fundamentally he's the wise king he's the positive archetype of the masculine and that's what he is
and so he is culture in it's positive manifestation and he gives rise to this creation which is his puppet
which is what culture does because you are a puppet of your culture a marionette of your culture
and so maybe you could be more than that
and that's the other thing that is strange about this movie and it's strange about the mythological way of looking at the world
because scientifically deterministically there is nature and there is culture
and you are the deterministic product of the interaction between nauture and culture
there is nothing else to you than that that's that!
But the mythological world doesn't say that it says something different
It says that there is nature and culture and then there is you!
And the you that's in there has choices and a destiny
and that you actually affect the interplay of nature and culture in determining your own character
and it insists upon that the oldest stories we have there is always the hero and the archetypal mother and the archetypal father
there is always those three things there is never just two
So from the narrative perspective there is always implication that there is something autonomous about
the hero of the story and you know you can't account for that we don't have a good way accounting that
for that from a scientific perspective I was having a discussion with Sam Harris the other day which
was very
what would you say he said we got wrapped around an axle which is pretty much Sam Harris is one of the four famous you know
atheists along with Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins and Dan Dennet yeah
and so we were having a discussion and he is a determinist just right down to the bottom
it's like you are determined you are determined there is no free will
You're a deterministic machine and you know if you are a coherent scientist and you are
a Newtonian roughly speaking you don't really have much choice other than to think that way but that isn't how it seems to people!
And we don't treat each other that way and our entire legal system is predicated
on the idea that you do in fact have free will!
So well can we account for it? Well no and do we have a scientific model for it? No.
But then I would also say that we do not have a scientific model for consciousness we don't know a damn thing about conciousness
Which is why Dan Dennet's book which was called Consciousness Explained
was referred to by its critics as Consciousness Explained Away
Which is exactly right as far as I am concerned because he took a mechanistic approach and
I just don't think you get to do that because
there is something really weird about consciousness I mean
the phenomanologists like Heidegger who tried to radically transform Western philosophy right from the bottom up
He basically said Well you know you can treat the world as if consciousness is primary and that
human experience is reality that's reality
and that it down't exist independently of consciousness in any explicable way
It's like well  what's out there if there is nothing to experience it.
Well everything at once it is something like that it's not really comprehensible as
without a subject the subject defines it and makes it real. Now you don't have to believe that but
at least I am telling you that there are thoroughly coherent philosophical positions that make that case
very strongly and that allow consciousness to exist as a phenomena and to take it seriously and
you certainly act like you take it seriously you act like there is a you and you make choices and
you certainly treat other people that way
deterministic or not you are still going to get angry when you know rude to you and
you are going to act as if they had some choice in the matter.
Now maybe that's an illusion possibly but maybe it's not.  And I would say the oldest stories that we have
always include that as not only the a fundamental element but even as the fundemental element
So well so you can think about that how ever you want but
Anyways so Geppetto comes along and he is going to finish off the puppet
And so what does he do to finish off the puppet he gives it a voice!
He gives it a mouth! Well that's really really interesting so
In Genesis in Genesis
this is a very very complex idea and it took people thousands of years to figure this idea out
and it's something like this so
At the beginning of everything there was chaos and that was like potential it was something like potential
the potential for being and God who is God the Father in the Genesis account
uses a faculty that he has which is the word to call being from chaos.
And that's the creation of being right it's the manifestation order from chaos
and it's the word the Logos that  it's the Logos that's the tool that God uses to do that and that Logos
in Christianity is associated with Christ which is a very weird thing but the reason for that is that
there is an idea that the divine element of the individual
is the thing that uses language communicative language to call the world into being
And that is what we do as far we can tell you make a decision you think it through you talk it over with your friends
you plot a course and the world manifests itself in relationship to you choice
and it's for that reason and it is for that reason that in Genesis and many other accounts
that Logos capacity is identified with human beings it's like you have a small bit of that in you
whatever that means and you participate in the process of
continually generating order out of chaos and sometimes the reverse you mediate between them
And so that in our in Western culture and it is certainly the case in other cultures as well that
that's why you have rights! Fundamentally that's why the law has to respect you
is because you have got this spark of divinity in you that's transcendent that nobody gets to transgress against
And you say Well do you believe that? It's like well you act like you believe it!
You treat other people like you believe it or they are not very happy with you
So it depends on what you mean by believe well you act it out. Well do you accept it as a proposition? Well
I don't care if you accept it as a proposition frankly because I think the best indicator of what you believe
is how you act not what you say.
Because what do you know about what you know hardly anything.
And so actions speak louder than words and if you want to be treated properly by someone is that you want to treat them
You want them to treat you as a valuable autonomous entity that's what you want
And so maybe you're not that maybe you are a deterministic puppet
and what this strange movie suggests is that you are a kind of deterministic puppet but you don't have to be
Alright
well the mouth goes on and then Geppetto is happy about that and then they have a little dance you know they
They turn the music on and all these little music boxes and
they all play together and it's like
harmony of some sort has been established because that's what the music represents and
there are layers of reality that are communicating with one another because that's what the music represents and then they have a little dance
and the idea is that well it's a good thing to let this puppet have it's own voice
Well that's an interesting idea because what the  hell does it know it's a wooden headed marionette
Why the hell would you want something like that to talk?
Well it's the same question you have in relationship to you children
It's like what do they know they are two or three you know they don't know anything
Well so should you just tyrannize them and make them do everything that you want or are you going to let them have a bit of a voice?
And the question is whether you want them to be a puppet or not.
And if you don't want them to be a puppet if you want them to grow up autonomous then then you let them have a voice.
And you facilitate the development of that voice and so
and that's and that's what you do if you don't want a marionette
So and Geppetto doesn't want a marionette so he gives the puppet a voice even though he knows it's just a puppet
and that it doesn't know anything
And then this is fantastic the cricket is sitting up there watching that he is pretty happy with it
that's the first little scene you see there and he is sitting by this other thing that is just not happy at all
And that's the terrible father and you see it's a character that repeats throughout the
entire movie you see manifestations of the tyrannical father continually through the movie
in different characters it's like he is played out by different roles
And so first of all the cricket is so thrilled about this and then he looks at the frowning king there
Who is not happy that the puppet has been given a voice he is a tyrant right he is the representation of a tyrant
and a tyrant does not want you to have a voice
And so the cricket looks at him and says
Well you can't please everybody all the time
and it's just a tiny little fragment of a joke you know but it's. There is this old idea
I think that it comes from Chekov and the idea is that if you set a play up and there is a gun a rifle
or a pistol on a table in the first act it had better been used by the third act or it shouldn't have been there at all
And the idea is you don't put anything in you play that's random you never do that it' like
because this isn't life this isn't life this is a work of art and everything
is connected and it is there by intent
And so this isn't accidental that this little king character doesn't like what is going on or that he shows up.
So anyways all the clocks go off and the music boxes go and the have a little dance and everybody is happy about it
And then Geppetto notices what time it is and there is a tremendous emphasis on time in this part of the movie
Because there are all these clocks going off and they are all telling him what time it is like 30 clocks go off and then he takes
watch out that and notices what time it is it's like the idea that there is something about time
going on is like whacked at you you know dozens of times so that you get it
And it's a little joke that he pulls out his watch and he figures out that it is time from bed
Well so now we are making the transition between the conscious world and the unconscious  world
OK so there is an intimation in the movie that everything that happens now is in the unconscious world
and the way you know that is that it's strange because the movie moves in and out this underworld
but at the very end when Pinocchio is transformed into a real boy
the last thing that Geppetto does is I think that it's Geppetto hit one of the pendulums and start all the clocks again
So it's as if what happens from here onwards is part of a dream
Now it's murky because Pinocchio goes to school and you know there is the next day and all of that but
and so those are sort of realistic elements but then there is the whole going down into the ocean
to find the whale thing that seems completely dreamlike
But there is an intimation that we are in a different kind of world and so
They all go to sleep including the cricket.
And so then Geppetto notices the star!
And because he is a good guy he makes a wish on the star and we have already
explained why you might wish on a star and what that might mean and he makes a very interesting wish.
It's not a self-serving wish in fact it's quite the contrary he doesn't wish that Pinocchio is an obediant son.
He doesn't wish that he produced someone who will work for him.
He doesn't wish any of that he wishes for what a good father would wish.
Which is that the creation that he has brought forth
would develop it's capacity for autonomy.
He wants him to become real he wants him to become an actual living creature and not and not a wooden headed marionette
And so you would say that is what your father should wish for you you know and I have clients
frequently whose father's weren't like that at all they were tyrannical or they were negelectful or
or the punished the person every time they did something good that's a real fun game.
They competed with them and undermined them at every opportunity they didn't want to produce someone strong and autonomous
They wanted to
give birth to a slave and then diminish it as much as possible
And so that's bad it's not good and so Geppetto is not like that so he says Well I am going to wish for
something completely unreasonable which is part of that ideal idea right?
And the unreasonable thing is that this puppet
could become
real! Could actually take on it's autonomy and move forward. And so that's what he wishes.
And then they go to sleep
And then the cricket starts to become driven mad by the noises of the clock so it's like he is going into this state of hyper-alertness
And the clocks are clanging at him and Geppetto is snoring and
he can even hear the little grains of sand falling out of the hourglass he is becoming hyper-alert
And then he yells Stop! and all the clocks stop
Which is a pretty good trick for a cricket you know he is the master of time but also we are in a place where time has
come to a stop we are outside of time.
And one of the things that Freud pointed out about dreams is that dreams are kind of outside of time.
Now here is what that means is first of all they draw on eternal themes that's part of it
but you know you must had had this experience Freud noted this carefully in the Interpretation of Dreams where
you know you are sleeping and the alarm will go off  and the alarm noise is incorporated into the dream
and it's like the dream has been going on for an hour in subjective time and you wake up and you realize that it is the alarm clock
It's like and there is no reason why your dream time should be the same as real time because it is all going on in your imagination but
It's amazing in some sense how much can happen in such a short period of time in your imagination and so
it's outside of time the world of fantasy is in some sense outside of time and so the cricket
tells time to stop and it does.
And then the star enlarges
and it turns into this blue fairy whose got a celestial gown covered with stars
and who has got wings so she is some kind of ethereal being and like you don't have a problem with that
in the movie it's like Yeah sure I mean you know it's a fairy that came from a star that makes perfect sense. which of course it's makes no sense
whatsoever
right it makes no sense but you are willing to go along with it because
on the one hand it makes no sense and on the other hand it makes perfect sense
It's like the fairy godmother idea it's like Yeah yeah fairy godmother no problem we got that.
And the idea there is that well Nature comes to your aid it's something like that
It's the benevolent force of Nature is on you side now not obviously only on your side
because it opposes you as well but
And there is your own mother as well who is also Nature whose on your side and so
but there is an idea here and the idea is that if the father gets the wish right
the aim right for the child
then Nature will cooperate
Right and that is true I believe that that's true is that
if you set up your relationship your cultural relationship with your child properly
then they are far more likely to flourish and so you get the magic of Nature on your side by
establishing the proper aim.  And so that's what happens Geppetto says well this is what I am aiming at
and because he is aiming at it and because it is in the realm of possibility maybe Nature comes to his service and
that is how it works that's exactly how it works because when you aim at something
then you muster your biological forces towards that goal and if the goal is
feasible and attainable then you will cooperate with yourself
And so that's quite cool Carl Rogers would call that
What's the word for that?
I think he called it genuineness which is kind of weak
but I think that is still what he called it he sort of meant that that's sort of what happens when your
goals and your physiological and biological being are alined well and you're
and you can communicate both you are not full of internal contradictions
And so your conscious aims and your biological possibilities are manifesting themselves in the same direction
and so that would be good!
So anyways the fairy shows up and she is quite sexually attractive she is quite provocative
and she charms the cricket
who gets all blushes and like is all you know embarrased and
overwhelmed by this like figure of celestial beauty and decides to cooperate the conscience decides to cooperate
and gets some responsibility and so
the fairy allows the puppet to move without strings
So that's kind of interesting it's the intervention of Nature. Culture focuses the aim
and then it's the intervention of Nature that produces the autonomy
and that seems to be right I mean even though it's not that understandable it seems to be right.
And then so she
takes the strings off Pinocchio and you might say well that's partly because your child is not
certainly not just a creature of culture by no means your child has a temperament you'll see that right away
and that temperament will unfold
and hopefully it will unfold in a cultural context that's amenable to it and that the combination of those two produce something new.
He can talk
he can walk
and so the good fairy basically tells him that
he has got a bit of autonomy and now it is up to him to
like clue in a bit and act properly and learn the difference between good and evil and to speak truthfully and all of that it's a bit
propagandistic that part of the movie I would say but it doesn't really matter it is kind of the inculcation of conventional morality
and there's a fair bit to it especially that he is supposed to tell the truth
and you know he says he will and the cricket is listening and then
the puppet asks Well what does conscience mean? because the fairy says always let your conscience be your guide
and he says Well what does conscience mean? and the bug whose like all puffed up because he wants to impress the fairy
pops down and gets on his little matchbox and gives this like horrible little lecture about
how to behave properly that's just like ideological chatter you can hardly even stand listening to it and
it's supposed to be like that it's generic moral advice that anyone could give
that is kind of dull and also puffed up and grandiose he's just not very good at it
So that's why he is on his little matchbox there with his chest puffed out and so
he says That's just the trouble with the world today. [sarcastic falsetto]
and I think that's his opening line you know
He's diagnosing the whole world and you know the fairy she thinks he is kind of funny because he is
And you know  it's sort of there is a real interesting thing here going on because he's male and he's
he's all puffed up with his knowledge which is completely shallow and he is put in contact with this like celestial feminine ideal
and he just turns into a complete moron and that's exactly what happens to men it happens to them all the time
So anyways she decides to give him a chance and turns him into this conscience and all of a sudden
he's this 1920's millionaire so he's he has been ennobled  but then she tells him that you know
he has to journey along with Pinocchio in order for things to go properly and he promises that he'll be a good conscience and do it
and he already thinks that he can do it
and that's why he is on the matchbox podium you know espousing his morality but
the reality turns out to be much more complex
The bug has a little talk with the cricket [sic] the bug has a little talk with the puppet
the bug tries to tell Pinocchio explicitly what it means to be good.
And he gets completely tangles up in the explanation because what the hell does he know
and the puppet doesn't understand anything says anyways so there is message there and the message is
the kind of knowledge that the conscience and the puppet are supposed to co-create
is not something that you can articulate easily as a table of rules it's not like that
because life is too complicated to just have five rules that you live by and that will solve every problem
partly because the rules will conflict that's a huge part of the problem right
One moral guideline contradicts another in a situation it's like you don't know what to do
So anyways they decide that they're
They decide that they are just going to
He says Pinocchio says Well I will be a god boy. and the cricket says Well that's the spirit! and then well then
Geppetto gets wind of it and they have a little like horror episode
and then he finds out that the puppet can
he is autonomous and they have a little party which tells you
exactly what Geppetto is up to is the autonomy emerges and he is happy about it it
So it's stamping home the notion that Geppetto is in fact a good guy and that is in fact what he wants
So it's like the encouragement of your father is the precondition for the emergence of your individuality
And it also allows the feminine to play a role both as Nature and perhaps as mother
and so the combination of those two things produces the autonomous individual it's like that seems perfectly reasonable
So off they go to sleep the next day they wake up
and it's a new day and Pinocchio is off to school and that's a good thing too because
Geppetto isn't and he is really excited about it and so what that means is that
He's been parented properly he is going to go out in the world of his peers which is where he belongs
and Geppetto isn't to worried about it in fact he is pushing him out the door you know
It's like go you can do it this is the next thing!
The kid isn't cowering in the corner and cowering in terror with the parents freaking out about all the things that are going to go wrong it's
There is some faith in his ability so
he sees all the kids wandering by and Geppetto dresses him up and sends him off to school.
And so and so that's good that's a happy family story it's like Mom and Dad got together they decided that the
kid was going to you know be competent and autonomous and ready to face the world and so
out he goes and so he's like five years old at this point and that is where we get
that's were we are at
in the story.
And I think that that is a good place to stop because the next thing that happens is
anomaly essentially Pinocchio goes off to be a good boy
but it turns out that is a hell of a lot more complicated than he might think because
there are actually complications in the world but also malevolence
Right the desire for things not to go right there are people who are not oriented towards
the ideal in any way at all and Pinocchio is young and naive
and so he has no defense what whatsoever against this malevolance and that's you know
That's not unexpected and it also turns out that the conscience the cricket who is still not very clued in oversleeps
And so he's just not there at a critical moment
But I think that we will pick that up next week because this is a good point in the plot to stop
The child has entered the broader world and has to cope with it
And so he's prepared because he had a wonderful father and he had a magical mother
and so he is prepared as you can be he is even not completely a marionette anymore
but now it's up to him that's the thing now it's up to him his parents have done basically what they could
And that's really about right you know
It's wise I would say psychologically
Alright so that's that!
